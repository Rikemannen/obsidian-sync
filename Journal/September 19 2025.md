Uhh we had math just now, we did a physics test abut heat, and it was 9 questions with one bonus quesstion to write more to write more bout what you know/have learnt on top of the other stuff, i wrote about how refrigerators work. I also had to get an additional paper to write onsince i had written all i could on the first one, and well i got up, took a paper, sat down on the chair on the wood thing that was in the way ad ripped a hole in my pants :)
Idk what elseto say really, we had german, with the words, it went well, we also did some things in our books, but since we also read, the class was over pretty quick.
We have tech or whatever now and i was the one who  read the pages in the book, since everyone wants that :) Uh yea thats it i just wanna write that :P
