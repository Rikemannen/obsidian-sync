I dreamt about doing puzzles to get somewhere in a huge city, some where electricity, some were like wood.

You know th- nah im jk ive just come home after school rn.
Im gonna try to change my routine a bit. Well anyways i cant really write about anything at home rn since, well, i havent been at home for more than 10 min.

I never know where to start when i write this so ill just write whats most interesting
Firstly, during swedish class i was really bored. So i tried to see my phone with scrcpy, well it worked yay! Anyways i then went to help the people on the table next to mine (guess who they were!) and well i just stayed with them after that. Of course they made some jokes like asking me if i was a femboy or gay. Well i did answer "yes of course" but im pretty sure they think im joking and just playing along. Well what do i know?

During english class we had hw, i tried to learn all of it and well i *did*, but i just got half of it all. The other ones were past present whatever tense of some words, i got 3 wrong (one line with the same word, i got the wrong word since it didnt say word in english). We then watched the truman show again and its **soo** good bro. Well mission impossible is better yadda yadda but its a good movie (god i need to rewatch m.i.), i really wanna watch movies rn lol. There is also a song that i got stuck in my head for a day, its called "philip glass - anthem, part 2".

We ate chicken for lunch (guess who i sat with at lunch! (idk why this is so cool bro, i guess cuz i have guaranteed non-homophobe friends, who knows)
Ima bake brownies tomorrow, i cant be arsed rn, im so lazy omg.
