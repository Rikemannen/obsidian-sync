I dreamt about playing/watching the world Championship or Olympics which was set at our school. There was a table with a projector showing most peoples locations.
I also got kicked or whatever for the first round since i blocked the way for someone once. Idk much more.
I also dreamt about some uranium alarm being activated and taking a small uranium sample and throwing in a containment thing. There was then some green gas in the room which turned out to be fake, so it was a drill, but wtf did i throw?

Alright we have now swum, anyways first 8 lengths were really hard since it has stomache swim or whatever and i suck at it. It was 200 meters total, then 2 back swims which was really easy, idk why im so good at the latter.
While we were chanigng to our normal clothes, wait
i showed sofias the writing and she was suprised lol. Anyways while we were changing again after swimming i ripped my underwear. Oh well most of mine are anyways, and well i decided not to bring the fresh ones to that so thats one thing.

Im now waiting for my mom to pick me up for volleyball. Im wondering if i should get pancakes or nah. I did eat a bit cuz it was like kale and meat which is pretty good. Whatever uhh during pe we played harry potter, yeah it was real fun, first round we won, then the second one i was real hyped fsr (i dont mind lol) and i saved our cones a lot really easily, but i went out ofc, alwin was last but he also got hit. Oh well it was fun :) but... basketball (we had after) was not, they kept getting fouls and blaming eachother. I just do not like it....
Oh and when changing i remembered that i forgot my towel, i used melvins cuz he used mine a while ago. Anyways uhh the guys also said that they are not looking forward to volleyball tournament :(
If im being totally honest here, im pretty sure i'll have transitioned before that even is, so i dont gotta worry about that.

Idk what else to write, we had swedish and worked a bit more on those texts and other questions in the book, the teacher read one text (not from us) that was on an E level yk, and it was like 250 words... Mine is 50. I suck at swedish, but i dont hate it??
We had math, we switched places again since his app could like have two classrooms so y not? I got placed in front of jenny and niva :D
Math was fun aswell, it wasnt *that* loud in the classroom.

Oh my god i didnt mention, during lunch i sat with niva and jenny, it was fun, anyways they said something about me being gay and so i got to correct them :D, niva immediately picked it up yk, but jenny was in denial fsr. Idk if jenny knows im really serious?
