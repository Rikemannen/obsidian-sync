Idk what i dreamt about.
I woke up early, and fell asleep again. The kid sleeping over was then going to wake me up, and when he went into my room he didnt, he checked out the box with models ive made. I opened my eyes and sat up, and he wasnt looking so i threw Femmy (omg i actually wrote that :O) at him and he jumped like crazy.

We ate small pancakes for breakfast, and for lunch we ate pancakes at the pancake place. They tasted like flour, well not really, but they werent good. There were also another family there with us and i then went and played with them after the other two left. I drove an excavator, a pedal car and pet a cat, the cat was really nice until you touched a specific spot on its neck, then it got furious.
I also wore my thigh highs the whole time there >:3

Im starting to think more about getting clothes and stuff rn. I will buy the sockies that i want when they are in stock, along with matching arm warmers. I then want a skirt soo bad but idunno how to get it. I dont want to shop online and shopping alone is really weird, especially as a guy shopping for skirts lmao. Ive thought of two things, in order from best to "worst" option:
1. Come out to my girl friends in school and go shopping with one of them, really easy to play it off in the store
2. Come out to my mom and same but with her
I do want to wait with coming out to my family until ive gotten a bf or *atleast* know half certainly what i am, rn i cant quite *put my finger on it (laughs as old timer).*
I might actually do it next week, or maybe wait until ive gotten thigh highs? I also want a hoodie btw. This is so confusing and annoying, but yet... so fun. I cant wait! Well i *can*, thats kinda why i havent done it yet. God this sucks.
