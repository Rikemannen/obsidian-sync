I got to build something with bubbles wrap on a huge roll, also had what seemed like a normal school class.

Yet another evening up late journaling, this time im doing it on my laptop, 127.76% easier.
Ill start with this, today during history, we did some timeline of the french revolution (fuck i hate timelines). I started, and it went pretty HORRIBLE. I litterally went to my friend like 15 times just to see how they did it. Eventually i got something going, but that whole period i was constantly panicking. And of course i didnt get that much done, and on top of that, tomorrow is the last day to do it. Yea you go ahead and try to make a timeline of something you (tried to) learn in like 3 hours, with 1 hour a day, having 1.5 hours spread across 2 days to do it. Bro i promise all of those fucking subjects in that group, history, religion, geography etc. can go fuck themselves. I hate them so much bro. And the instructions are just non existent or on a level only a few of the worlds geniuses would (barely) understand.

And then we switch one letter of the two letter word that is the name of that group, and we get the natural subjects. Holy hell, interesting subject, interesting teacher. What is missing? Today we were in the bad classroom for physics, so we just talked and asked questions yk. And i answered so many questions with the answer the teacher was looking for that eventually there was no point in raising my hand, i wasnt gonna get to talk anyways :P. It was about heat transfer and boiling eggs in microwaves, burning yourself on the oven etc.

Then we move to art. Today we kept training grafitti. And i tried to copy the thing on the computer. It sucked ***âœ¨assâœ¨***. But then i tried something revolutionary. I wrote my name in fairly big letters, normal font, and just made an outline with sharp edges ðŸ¤¯ It turned out *amazing* compared to the other crap. Now i just gotta figure out what to draw as representing me. I thought of a bk in the empty space of the U, but it turned out ass. So idk what ill do, we will see :3c

Tomorrow we are gonna take photos for... something? Like for real, why cant we get a yearbook or whatever. Just send out a god damn contract or flyer or whatever for our parents to sign acknowledging that i can get photographed with gdpr or whatever. Its frankly lame af. Oh and other stupid school stuff include the fact that we can get money for lunch now during work visits or whatever tf you wanna call it if we meet certain requirements, 40 smackaroos a day * 5 days, thats 200. But noooooo, we cant afford to give you a bus ticket to an event that we **force** you to go to, that certain people who ride buses get the bus ticket for free with their special bus passes, but you, as someone who still rides a bus to school **every. single. day.** and has for more than **8 FUCKING YEARS** not missing more than 15 days **EVER**, will not get a paid one, that simple. Oh and did i mention, the ticket costs a little less than the price of a day of lunch money for the work stuff, and, it happens ***twice a year***, the food thing, **5 days** for **one week**, **one week in spring**, and **one in fall**. Even though its not just one person riding the bus in this scenario, it still comes out as cheaper, since 11 people could ride with their fucking tickets one way, or 5 two way, and ***it still wouldnt really cost as much, being a tad bit cheaper.*** THAN ONE PERSONS LUNCH MONEY???? (And everyone knows DAMN WELL that there isnt just one person getting lunch money). Fuck this bs.

At home ðŸ¤—:
Before going home i brought my history books (spoiler alert, didnt do shit with them) and the sacred book that is too "good" to read in school. I also got a new magazine! I then bought ets2 for my friend who wanted it. I also found out that i am getting 3k as pay (kr not dollar :P) so thats awesome. Apollo also wanted to play (they messaged me during a break between classes asking if i could play and what, told him we could later), here is the conversation:

Basically he wanted to play a peak ripoff, i heard that the devs hated the ripoff and wanted people to pirate the game rather than play it, and well, as mentioned i was gonna get a shitload of money, AND the game was on sale. So i just bought two copies, one for me and one for him. We played for 2.7 hours. Full (Almost, some got deleted) chat message copy can be found somewhere in documents or on hdd idk, depending on when you read this it can be anywhere!

Anyways thats about it, no thigh highs to school, we ate same dinner today as yesterday (sausage thing and rice if i didnt write), my tailbone hurts like crazy when i sit (probably broken or smth D:), im tired, and this has been my 2nd longest entry as of.. well today, mainly due to the chat message paste, [[August 25 2025]] still beats it tho. Gonna sleep, stay tuned for tomorrow, if ur not reading this after tomorrow that is ;D
