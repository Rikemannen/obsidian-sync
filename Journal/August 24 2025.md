I dont remember exactly what i dreamt about, but i think it was about robbing something, and my team just couldnt figure something out.
In another dream i was in a spot in the woods or whatever and they had brought a wagon with a stage, and i had a rock we could use to Shield from the rain. Well then the rock also became a wagon and one friend wanted to combine them, it didnt end up well.

Test for git!!
