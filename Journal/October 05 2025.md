No Lucid dream, i didnt wake up `._.`
I dreamt about halloween, me, my grandma and brother were going to her place to be there. Once there (it was actually the school fsr) we built some candy sculpture. I dropped ours once but it was fine.

Anyways my mom told me we are going to eat out today and buy a jacket for me. And that just made me not wanna get out of bed fsr. She said shed call the dog to my bed if i didnt and she did but he didnt come. Anyways idk what jacket to buy, i dont really use one but we'll see.

We are on the way to shop now and i just cant stop thinking about yesterday, i am so fucking fucked. On Monday there is a very huge chance that everyone will find out. Oscar will most likely tell everyone he can. Although, he didnt really yesterday, i dont think. But its just what he does. What the fuck do i do im so scared, like i dont want this. Ill have to tell him if he seems like he would do it.

We have now come home. We ate at mister york since there was one where we went, we being me and mom, the others ate china buffet or asia or smth at the mall. The hamburgers were **really** good.
At the mall we bought like 3 tshirts for me and nothing else. I really wanted to tell my mom that i want "girl" clothes (in parenthesis since it shouldnt be gendered but it is :/) anyways i did joke about it when she told me i could get anything, i said "ooh i want that that and maybe that" in the girl section.
Anyways i was really hungry the whole time and not in a good mood. Thats about it ig.

Oh and i read something today, some person said that they couldnt stop wondering if they were trans or not, and someone commented that cis people dont think like that, so they have to be trans *to some extent*. So i guess that applies to me aswell.

Oh i just remembered something. I am sooo fucked for tmrw, i come to school at 8:50, everyone else is there earlier. Everyone else will know before i can stop it. I will have a shit day tmrw :D Fuck i am not looking forward to this one bit.
