I felt mixed stuff today, i want to be a femboy, but at the same time i literally created [[Trans names (if thats what i want)]]. One thing is for certain i *preferably* want a boyfriend. I also feel a little genderfluid or nb. Idk...

I also wanna add, when coming out i can say this:
- I like wearing feminine clothes
- I am attracted to boys (main thing tbh) ^be27ca
- I dont quite know what i identify as, but i dont mind people calling me a guy, i can also say that i feel a little different each day (genderfluid), but not enough for people to change their behavior around me. NO, you know what it should be short:
- i am unsure what to be referred as, but dont mind it as it is.
- I would love of people just know this about me, without feeling the need to change their behaviour around me.
- BONUS: tell them about my journal and/or being a furry if i want to.

Yea i have no idea yay!
Most things i listed here ([[#^d5e99b]]) still stand (how tf do i make the link say here???) Although i do want to change point two ([[#^be27ca]]) to add "mainly", cuz its not really fully that, but mostly. And i do not know at all what i want to identify as, but im leaning towards masulinity today (i think omg).

I was just laying here thinking about transitioning, and i got a very odd feeling about actually going through with the process of it, and i cant say i hated it.  God i really want girl clothes so i can try that shit out. My body is fucking perfect for that shit.

Ya girls done it again, i am now researching about hrt stuff again, and im just so like sad or whatever cuz i feel like my voice will be fucked forever. (The dysphoria is actually coming for me omg) And i just dont know if im really a girl or just a femboy, but to be absolutely fucking honest, i feel like the things femboys do are maybe not really enough for me... And ive literally made [[Trans names (if thats what i want)]] and keep thinking and writing girl stuff, not feminine, but maybe im just dumb. God fucking dam it i hate this so much. I just hope to god and Jesus and all that is, that i am a little late in puberty. If god wanted me to transition, then thats what it is. Im so weird rn but omg. And i literally cant talk to anyone since i know no one who is queer whatsoever, and i do kinda have a little thing that makes me hate talking to random people. Should i just fucking do it, tell my friends and see what they say. I do *really* need to talk to someone, and.. im crying rn... I think ill do *it* if i dont turn out like i want. Do with that info as you will...
Ill start figuring shit out, talking with higher pitch to myself etc. But this actually keeps me up at night (22:00 rn hehe)
Motherfucker i even try to laugh femininely, is that femboy behaviour??
Ive thought about this one thing a little, my cousins have one old sister and one young bother, both families have that, and then we come to mine, two brothers, lets fix that :3c

Idk what got into me last night but whatever.
I read something today, about some guy (ftm) who wanted to transition but wasnt dysphoric about their feminine side. (literally me but in reverse) And another person responded saying that they just pretend to be happy about their fem side, while in reality they would be happier transitioning. And so idrk what to do :/
What i need to find out is if i am a femboy or trans. But how do i do that??

Here it is again, updated once again:

- I like wearing feminine clothes and want more of them
- I like boys
- I feel like i would be happier if i transition
Thats pretty fair right?

Omg im talking to myself in a higher pitch and i literally feel my throat doing the thing (if you get it ðŸ˜­) and it feels so good wth i love talking like a girl whattt. BUT:
I want to be a girl, but at the same time i want to be someones boyfriend, this is so fucking hard. I can also see myself in the tv when i play/write this and i dont like how i look while talking like this, it doesnt fit yk. I thing i do wonder is how i would feel if people at school called me a feminine name? Id like it (probably).
If i wasnt so paranoid for no reason whatsoever id talk like this when im home alone or going home from school alone etc. I mean i probably will but yk (you dont know cuz idek lol)
Another thought:
Once i got shopping i can go with Niva and Veronika (well probably the first of the two idk) and itll just look like two girls shopping together. Thatd be so cool, but who knows if they even will accept me??
My mom just called me and wanted help, and just before i took the call i thought about not swallowing and stuff to reset that thing in my throat. But just as i picked up i did, idek if such a thing is true or whatever where if you talk long enough like this you get used to it yk, but i dont really want her to hear this.
But to be real i dont want to be a girl, i want to present as one but not be one. I want to be a guy... I cant figure this shit out by myself rahhh

God im so tired of this. I hate it so much. I have been feeling dysmorphia today a bit and i just dont like my guy features. I just wanna be a silly girl. Yet i still kinda dont. DÃ¶dpywhwjdkf av ibo:)
Oh and my dad told my mom to check for booking for barber or whatever. I dont like this. Im gonna come out soon, i gotta talk. But i feel like people will laugh. I gotta include that i cant stop thinking about this and that its making me sad or smth.

I havent added the entries where i came out, read [[October 03 2025]] and [[October 07 2025]]. (Veronika doesnt know im trans, not from me atleast) And there you fucking go. I said it:
>*...doesnt know im trans...*
If **that** doesnt confirm it i dont know what does.
Yeah im trans, i love thinking about it. Im just wondering how ill tell the others that im not gay but bi, ill just wait for them to mention anything related and ill just say something like "oh actually im more so bi than gay, i just said that so youd understand." Which is a pretty good plan imo.

Its just so fucking nice getting this huge weight off my shoulders. Who knew me questioning whether i was a femboy turned into me being trans eventually. Yeah i said it, and ill say this:
The next time they bring something related up, i will ask them, "should i go on E?" or something yknow. Ill just ask them if i should do it. And if they say yes, ill come out to my mom. Yeah fire plan but ill do it. Oh and names, i really wanna brainstorm names with them. Stacy (as seen on [[Hehe, sexuality, mmm/Trans names (if thats what i want)|Trans names (if thats what i want)]]) is the best one so far. I like an English name even if im in Sweden. And holy, how will my cousins react, when they actively (well sometimes, *rarely*) joke about some enby person and their name change. Idk if they deadname then but i think not tbh. Anyways i just wanna add, theres not really anything about my voice anymore. I kinda found out how to train it and well i dont really sound like a man, more so a teenager (duhh).
Ima check out done voice training stuff cuz y not.
# 11 oct
Today is national coming out day?? Yeah well i didnt :P
Anyways i tried talking high pitched today, it sounded, well, high pitched. Idk what to do but its pretty safe to say that im bi and trans. Or atleast genderfluid. I do wanna do voice training but my ass is so paranoid for some fucking reason.
I really don't know what is stopping me from committing? (to becoming trans not suicide :P)

What i want in life:
- A partner, gender doesnt matter as long as they are:
	- Nice
	- Accepting
- Girl clothes:
	- Oversized hoodie, zip up or pull over doesnt matter but i think i actually prefer zip up
	- Skirt
	- Thigh highs (yes i know this is more femboy, idc)
- Long hair
- A girl voice
And most importantly:
- Hrt

Oh and let me tell you about my silly little rule i made just now. If anyone asks about me being, well anything, ill answer truly, assuming there is no risk of unwanted attention.

Goodnight. (To whom it may concern)

Dont misunderstand here, i still think about this kind of stuff all day every day, i just feel like its not interesting enough to add here. However since i told my friends i was bi not gay ive started accepting it, i mean its literally what i am. Time to change my passwords! The password for my laptops user account is `imsogay`, the root account password is `imsuchafemboy` like cmon none of that is correct. And to top it off my watch's passxode is 4080, which base26 encoded is "GAY". So ill change that back to what i had a little earlier when i couldnt think of anything, 4249, which is "BI" in hexadecimal. Yeah im a nerd, how'd you know?
