I dreamt that i was i at a family gathering or some event, and there was a furry :I. Dont know anything else.

I also woke up by my brothers stray alarm, since he was in our parents bed...

Oh damn im not journalling at night, waiting for bus, but i need to write this lol.
So right after last class ended today, Liam (?) told me that Millie liked me (idk if he was joking or not), and i just straight up told him "how nice, im gay", idk if he got it, he said "oh ill tell her that" and then "ill say you like her back", tf do i do if she confesses??? I mean i did like her in 5th grade i think, but not anymore (obviously).
