Uhh, i woke up, and then i pretty much immediately fell asleep, with the intention to Lucid dream, although i think it was just a normal dream since i didnt have control per say, i more so followed with. It started by imagining my room, then going out of it and downstairs, checking my hand to see if i was still Lucid, it went from 5 to 6 and back a lil all the time. I then went to the toilet and tried to see myself in the mirror as a girl, Yeah that didnt work. I then woke up for real.
This wasnt a Lucid dream :(
Although i did try the stuff i wouldve (last part :P)

I also dreamt about watching those guys's new movie that they released a couple days ago (ijustwanttobecool) and it being shorter than 2 hrs.

Anyways ima try to journal as much as possible today, cuz why not. This will be the longest entry i have made so far, i just know it :P

Also, ive really been thinking about the stuff in [[Fuck it, journal²]]. And idrk what's like stopping me or whatever. This shit is so hard :|
During the morning stuff talked about like wel idk i fforgot, probably wasnt important. fuck there was something that happenedgodo i keep getting distracted and whatnot, anyways during crafts just now duing the cleanup i went around with the trash bin and took wood chips or whatever directly from the tables, and once i came to Liam's table he got mad at me for doing it >:(
I fucking hate him and every single guy on this sch- wait no but like half the guys in our grade, they are so fucking annoying, and you cant get them to stop either. Anyways i really wanna try to journal more today like i said at the beginning but i probably cant since short day and we have physics now, which means no journaling and then pe whic, yet again means i cant journal.

Hehe we have physics now with substitute and we are "reading", im doing the things we should with the book for swedish and now im journaling cuz why not. As soon as i come caross the fwew poeple in this book that are homosexual or trans or whatever i get that like heart attack yk, i love this so much, or not idk its just fun ig. Journaling like this is also very fun..

WAit omg i just remembered something, yesterday (night) i cahanged my alarm volume as to hear it and wake up in the middle of the night, but i never set the alarm... im so dumb lmao.

We had baseball during pe and we ran 3 rounds around the football pitch where we played baseball, it was pretty annoying, after that we ate pasta and bacon sauca or wahtever  and then i went to the like tv yk in that room in the food cort and played some furry yt videos and played it off as nothing and then some top 5 op 5 honorable mentions.Im so weird, and to add to my weirdness, during lunch the others started mixing some potion with passta and ketvchup, milk water and whatnot, they said that the guy who drinks it (i sat with adam, alvar and their friends yk) and well they said who drinks it gets 3000 money, i acted like i was gonna do it. And then they said that whoever drinks it got a femboy bf, i drank it lmao, im so fucking weird oml (and gay :3)


oh and when i come home ima get those girls who want laser engraving there, and after that ima go to that place again and hangout with the other people, and ima bring the wii controllers and play wii sports or something, that would be fun. I just got a notification from my phone from r/teenagersbutcode???? i did fix that tho now :D

Omg after we quit German and were walking up the stairs to my locker and whatnot, i got stuck with my foot and my "shoe" went off. I got it back and laughed about it, and then Algot started messing with me about it or whatever, i took the shoe and smacked him in the head with it (stupidest thing ever), and then he started going after me just to pin me to the lockers and push me. If i had a weapon, yes this is probably weird or maybe not, i wouldve used it, no kidding. I am so fucking tired of these guys rn.

I did get my cable back that Oscar had forgot to give me, which was nice.
