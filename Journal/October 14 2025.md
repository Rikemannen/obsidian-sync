I woke up and didnt write down what i remembered... But i do remember dreaming about mark Zuckerberg calling me and then having me pick an important person in my life to call next, Yeah idk. I do remember not being able to pick who i wanted.

We now have lunch. The day started with me going out and doing the morning routine. I went a little wrong tho and missed one group, so i walked on the side of the fence to check them. When i was done i took the same way back to avoid the road, and then me and Adam went to the mountain to check the sheep cows and goats. It was hell walking since my shoes made my ankles hurt. We also measured a shed which wasnt as bad lol. And now we are here, at "home" eating, i brought fettucine alla meat sauce or something.
The morning routine took less battery on the golf cart today, i wonder if thats cuz im light unlike the adults. I also sent a vid of me driving to Melvin cuz y not.

Holy shit this meal was good.

We sorted sheep after that and when we were taking the last few in a small pasture or whatever one had escaped since the fencing was broken. We moved the last few, and they were sorted by who was gonna participate in some competition and some who werent. Me and Adam then went to fix the fencing. It went well. But then i remembered that i have volleyball training. So i told him and he said hed drive me home. And so he did.

At home i was alone for like 3 minutes and then my mom came. And she wondered why i was home, i told her and she showed me that i was an hour early. I went at around 15:10, one hour early, when i didnt have training until 17:00... And now im just so mad at myself for not checking, i didnt even tell them beforehand... Im so fucking irresponsible. Oh well ima eat something now and get even more mad. The others are outside chasing geese, theres like 389 of them.

Alright im home now and have just eaten, during volleyball my mom also stayed and talked with nivas dad, i got info that niva didnt have a place to work this week :( among others like the team i play in never has matches with other teams and that youd have to go to another city to get that, since a few amount of people liked volleyball in my age (prob guys, thats gonna go down by 1 soon :P). Anyways today we started with the thing we did the thing we started with [[October 07 2025]], then we did some thing where one side serves, and the other is basically a team that was supposted to pass around and to the passer to then kick the ball over. But that turned to shit and didnt work, so we moved on to serving instead. I didnt get if we were doing over or underhand-serves so i just did both lol. After that we did a match and then we were done. I told my mom to fill my water bottle the last switch but that was unnecessary :P
On the way out we talked with Niva and her dad about driving together or whatever since she otherwise had to take the bus on thursdays. Oh and then my mom realized she had left the car keys inside `._.` She went and got them and i sat on a cold stone "bench" and waited.

On the way home and there *and at home* i talked a **lot**. I just couldnt shut up lol. Oh and on the way there she also said that its "good" or whatever i dont remember, that it didnt matter if i was in a group full of girls and that i could "ignore" it, again i dont remember exactly. And the look i made (without her seeing) was pretty revealing of why that was. I did think about coming out but nah. Idk why i didnt really.

Anyways i have showered and eaten chili con carne and talked and im journaling. Ill stop now tho. Ok bye until later.

Ive now solved an issue where network manager didnt work on my pc and so i had to use a live iso. I then made .local addresses work on my laptop pc and pi, pi already worked but i changed the address to pi.local
I also set up openwebui and ollama to use if i want. And im thinking of putting a smart outlet or whatever for my pc and make it start on ac return or whatever so i can wake-on-lan-without-lan.
I also listened to some music cuz otherwise i wouldve died of boredom.

Also my mouth hurts like crazy, i have bitten my tongue as if its chewing gum, gotten a blister, and my earn hurts in sync with all this somehow.

Ima go sleep now, im tired af. Goodnight.

Also i saw a post a while ago about liking wheatley in portal 2, but they misspelled wheatley as whetl, that sounds so funny i gotta mention it.
-Whetl lover ❤️
