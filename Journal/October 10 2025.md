I dreamt about watching a movie about a party, and yet again i eventually was in it. There were like those Thiefs from the movie and stuff idk what to say, it ended with a planning of the outside which had a port and some bumpy grass idk. I also dreamt about being able to fly by jumping and moving my legs a certain way in the wind. But i didnt Lucid dream, i fell back asleep...

Alright i havent journaled for a lil now. We started with german, we got new places t o sit. For some weird reason the teacher put all the guys on one side and the girls on the window row. We did some stuff in the work book there.
We then had math,  we sat with the places we got yesterday there (its in the food house, idk what to call it) And mine is pretty good (i sit in front of niva yk, theyre fun to talk with) During math we did some volume and geomtry stuff ( we did geometry im on volumes)
We then had tech, we had a test which was prettty easy. I got done pretty quickly since i had to leave early (spoiler alert, it was unnecessary) to go to the vision store (wtf is it called??) and check my vision to drive car. It went perfect, first thing i did was some scan or whatever and i got to see that house image! it was cool how i recognized it :)
I then came in the middle of swedish, and we did the book stuff, i didnt do much since it was almost ending. Then we ate pasta and paprika sauce for lunch. After lunch i played volleyball with melvin alwin niva jenny veronika (she was here today) and adam, aswell as sinna (nivas sister, idk if i mentioned) and her firned but they left, it also started raining a bit.
Now we have english and once again ignas is behaving like a fucking child, he took headphones and is watching ai videos on his laptop?? hes a joke
Oh and we also checked results for the truman show text we did and i along with some others like melvin got A, ignas got C, he just doesnt fokus correctly. OK i now see that it isnt ai video hes watching but wth doesnt matter.
I didnt sit with niva and veronika today in the food court, and it was really dry between me alwin and melvin... so there is a pretty clear reason as for why im sitting with them :P
I just started rewriting my text in english from scratch, and holy shit did it turn out better and longer, just focusing on one thing excpt for two. I cooked real hard with this one:

> Privacy, a very important topic of today's modern society. It is both an important and very sensitive topic among certain people. In this day and age of tech everywhere we need to be mindful of what we do in public. But why is this? Why do we need to think about someone catching anything embarrassing, private or just something we do daily, on camera? I believe that social media, especially the fact that anything can be famous if it comes from the right person, is scary when talked about in conjunction with privacy. Let’s create a scenario here:
> 
> You are walking in the park and you trip over a stray rock. And on the other side of the park is a tiktoker filming a dancing video with their friend, suddenly someone trips behind them and is caught in the video. They now upload the video with you tripping halfway in and get a load of people laughing at the random person just coming in and tripping.
> 
> That just feels wrong, why laugh at someone tripping, as if you yourself have never done that in your life? Now let’s also be realistic here. Those people filming, are going to be teenagers, and the people commenting and liking, are going to be teenagers, and someone is always going to do this. Now picture this but in a school environment… see how that pretty much will go bad? Oh and let’s not forget the other group of reasons to disallow phones in school, such as the focus being nonexistent, no socialising between students, and, what is stopping the students from searching for the answers instead of solving problems and developing their skills?
> 
> However, it can’t be all bad, right? And well yeah, of course there are some positive things about the phone, you might say things such as viewing the schedule for today, calling people who may miss a class or just sparing the teachers from having to collect/hand out the phones at the start and end of the day.
> 
> However, in my opinion, the negatives greatly outweigh the positives, and so my conclusion is that allowing students their phones in school is a very very poor idea, due to outcasting, loss of focus and cheating. Sure there may be some positives, but there is just such a risk attached with it, that in the end, it will most likely not function.

I let agnes and niva+sofia read my text and they said it was good. Niva and sofia were emphasising the synonyms i added *very* much, such as "modern society", "lets create a scenario" They do think its good tho :>

Im home now, i went to the store with Niva and Veronika just before going to the bus, i left my bag at the bus and then we walked next to the construction even if we shouldnt, i bought those chocolate wafers. I then said bye and walked another way back (well i kinda ran since the bus left in like 3 min...)
On the bus a couple of people asked for some and i just said ill eat them at home. At home im eating a pizza. 

I also wanna mention that during the vision test i got a stick to cover one eye. When i did it myself it went well, however when the person in there did it i twitched like crazy. I mean i cant help it but why do i do it? She also put a lamp in my face and made me follow a ball on a stick (not at the same time).

[[October 05 2025]] yk the game i talked about here, yeah good news, i kinda found it (https://www.roblox.com/games/9559194006/RIOT-social-experiment), bad news, the devs havent rated it and so it remains unplayable :((((
Oh and to top it all off, the main dev is dead D:
Oh well it was good while it lasted. I loved that game so much. I never liked it tho (as in clicking the button on roblox, ofc i liked the game yk) so i cant proove i played it. Eh, to whom do i have to anyways?

Dont ask why but i just came up with something randomly while playing ragdoll universe (not related).
>*Queue the best, kill the rest*
Basically it means to get the best people in a group and just not take the rest, queue the best, take the best, kill the rest, remove the rest. Very good imo.
