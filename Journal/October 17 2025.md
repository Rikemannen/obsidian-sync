I dont remember details about my dream, however i do know that i once realized in the dream that i was in a dream by doing a reality check `._.` but that doesnt mean i had a lucid dream. What i remember is that there were like rooms and you had your own, kinda like the game social experiment... God i wanna play that again. I also dreamt that i had bought pride flags for my room, one rainbow yk and the other idk, trans maybe?
Anyways i also sung happy birthday for my mom 

Ok some things i have forgot to mention the past days, yesterday at the party there was a guy named max there, and when i showed videos to the others, he always spoiled what the joke was etc if he recognized it... And ive also listened a little to the pi song 2.0 and it seems like i know it now... Yay!

Oh and why do famous people keep dying this year? We had people during summer and today we had Ace Frehley from kiss, damn.

I started with my routine, duh, i also measured the manure, it was cold af outside too, however measuring the temps wasnt all too bad this time. After that we moved a pasture and i figured out a revolutionary technique of putting a fencing stick on the wires and then dragning that along, putting it in the ground and setting another stick next to it where you want it, and then keeping in going. That made sure the wires are at the correct height and not jumbled together.
After that me and Otto went and picked up some sheep close to the golf course. And then we are eating now, and we are gonna eat chocolate cake later.

We are now gonna eat cake, i kinda already know it isnt gonna be that good, but whatever, i have so far been just putting mud on the walls, we are doing the last one directly on the plank now. My thumb also hurts like crazy.

Nvm the cake was pretty good lol, i ate 3 pieces, Adam ate 2.5, Otto 1.5 and anna 1

Home at last. Now is this good enough for a journal about my days?
