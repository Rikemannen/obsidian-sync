So i woke up at 2:15 and stayed awake a little, but fell back asleep. I then dreamt that my dad had bought fuckloads of tomato sauce or something.
Bro my mom put a fucking egg clock under my pillow wth. Ima pretend it wasnt there.

Bro we have english now and ignas is acting like a god damn 5 year old saying he doesnt need his computer and then smiling at the rest of the pople here when te teacher pretends to take it, this is so messed up.

we had deutsch, why did i type like that, anyways now we have physics, before german some guys destroyed a table by flipping it and stuff, yk those rounds ones, and the table part came off, the screws. And now right before physics, Nelia in like 6th or 7th grade got the chinese swing (idk what it is cALLED SRY) oop caps anyways she got it in her neck, and the ambulance is here and everyone is looking, standing by the window etc.
until later ig.

I added a new name to [[Hehe, sexuality, mmm/Trans names (if thats what i want)|Trans names (if thats what i want)]], its my favorite one so far. Im sorry but [[Fuck it, journalÂ²]](im not sry lol) oh and while writing down that name my mom came up the stairs, and i was at my pc, im really damn lucky she looked at her phone and not me or the pc, i panic-closed the window lol.

Anyways i packed shitloads of stuff today. Swimming, pe and volleyball.

Some school stuff:
Idk who, but someone, right before German, said me and Adam should come to that girls night thing or whatever. And i pulled the best joke ever imo, "we'll come as a lesbian couple". Which tbh, not with him but me, might happen. Yeah my sexuality has changed, i feel bi, i mean i always did, but i denied it. I now embrace it. Yeah you read nothing, i was never gay, I FOOLED YOU. MUHAHAHA. Or no, sorry, tihihihi.

Well i did that, and its really easy, so ima start doing it, some big dog small dog stuff and a "whistle" thing. Oh and ima watch a "10 min tutorial" too.

Oh and i played Fortnite with Melvin, but the match right before i asked him, i won with a crown, which was pretty nice.
