I dreamt that i was i at a family gathering or some event, and there was a furry :I. Dont know anything else.

I also woke up by my brothers stray alarm, since he was in our parents bed...

Oh damn im not journalling at night, waiting for bus, but i need to write this lol.
So right after last class ended today, Liam (?) told me that Millie liked me (idk if he was joking or not), and i just straight up told him "how nice, im gay", idk if he got it, he said "oh ill tell her that" and then "ill say you like her back", tf do i do if she confesses??? I mean i did like her in 5th grade i think, but not anymore (obviously). 

All that, move aside! Here comes late-night-journaling vol. 2/9!
Well today we finally finished our timelines in history, and mine didnt turn out half bad. We also got an assignment to write down which of the timelines from the people at our table were best.

And something i forgot to mention that happened yesterday is following:
Our physics teacher said he specifically wanted four girls to do an experiment "as when guys did it they tried being tough and ruined it" (youll get it)
He got 4 testers, each got a rod made of copper, brass, aluminium and stainless steel. They then had to hold it above a flame, and see which material got hotter faster. And here is where guys apparently held it even if it got scorching hot (he said some people burned themselves!). He even said that "he was sorry for the gender discrimination (?)" just as if he meant
"Everyone who is a guy will take a rod here and hold it til they cook their blood." Which i dont think more than 2 people in my class would do, like shit hurts (im certainly not one of them). And of-fucking-course i, the perfectly sane human person i am, definitely did not think about how this wouldve turned out if we had a trans person (prob me) in our class.

Whatever, i got some more cool facts from the girl in our class who can read people or whatever. She told me that my favorite sentences are:
1. God im stupid
2. You idiot (to items not people)
3. Ill shut up
(Not exactly since translated from Swedish but whatever)
I feel like i *might* be too harsch on myself. Maybe just a little.

I told my physics teacher that i would fix the printer today, and i did bring an sd reader, but lo and behold, after school when i was supposed to do it, i forgot and when i was at the bus stop i just didnt bother. Ima say i was going shopping or something if he asks (knowing me i know ill just say it anyways...).

Today i also forgot my charging brick after German class ended, i ran from the one house to the other, but my brother was gonna have class in that room (and it was locked) so i told him where it was and asked if he could get it, then i ran back, i made it before the teacher even came. After school was over, he came to the bus stop and i asked him if he had it, he said he didnt find it, then pulling it out of his pocket. I deserved that one :/

Lastly, at home i played a lot of ragdoll universe and made two friends, one didnt add me tho, one was named peanut something and the other mr ben. After playing for a while i wanted to take a break, and idk if it was right after i did, but i wanted to "fix" my pc's partition setup, since i hadnt set up subvolumes on my btrfs partition. I made subvolumes, moved and deleted files etc. And eventually was left with a non functioning system with a ton of missing files. So i reinstalled. The system lasted 3 whole days. Anyways i was much quicker at it today, except that i forgot that you have to type `NetworkManager` and not `networkmanager` or anything else when enabling the service. Only took me 10 minutes to figure out. I did some more fun customizing with window buttons, loading screen and more that i dont remember.

One last thing, well two, but i kinda forgot one, we had tacos in school for lunch today!! I ate 2 oversized ones. Dam i really forgot the other thing

Also a reflection, if i had continued journalling like i tried it at the start with that ugly ass template, i wouldve stopped doing it for sure.

Idk if theres more, if so i wont write it today. Maybe add on to here tomorrow if i feel like it.
