I dreamt about being in the us and trying to get home before school started, but i was stuck trying to order at McDonalds since there were so many things like cheese blocks and pineapple that you could buy. I eventually went to the cashier to order, but i woke up. I remember the screens were at a website called "spendrups" or smth...
I also dreamt about being at some sponsored event with shitloads of food, but that made me late or smth so i time traveled away from that to not get late..?

I have now woken up, i did take my new pants, however my mom got an "old" shirt for me. When she was looking for a shirt to have outside i said that she could take my hoodie. So yea im also gonna get my thigh highs later.

Uhh im just journaling now cuz why not, i just had music, i played with Jamie most of the time, it was fun... :)

Anyways we are waiting for math to start now, and oscar just told me he was having a little thing at laserdome, and he invited me :D
And the other guys in the class are being such fucking bitches about it, they are sitting behind me rn but they cant see that im talking smack about them :P
Anyways they keep saying that only stupid people can come and that its a birtday party even though its not, they do it to be mean and funny, but how the actual hell is that funny?

I forgot where i was, they are now asking if they should bring gifts cuz they keep saying its a party.
Nicholas is saying he can give a high five as a gift, god he is so fucking annoying, i hate that little prick bro.
Oh and nobody has said anything about me wearing a hoodie today :O
Well idk why that would be but yay
One thing that i am thinking about rn is that quote i read a while back:
*Treat everyone with respect until they prove that they don't need that kind of treatment*, its so fucking good bro and applies to most guys in my class (except for my friends :D)
We have just eaten meatballs, they tasted like ass :(, we also had math, i didnt do jack shit. Im now sitting and waiting for history to begin, tbh im kinda sad rn :(
I just want someone that can somewhat relate to me when i talk about my problems, but that doesnt exist in my vincinity :(
Uhh Ignas/Liam or whatver just broke a new ping pong racket, and they are still throwing them around :/ They also broke ignas's cap :D
And they are doing shit (they=valter) with melvins computer.
Uhh Algot was just like strangling melvin.... idk if it was soft or nah but what the hell??
And then i told him to stop it, and he was just like "oh hello!
And so i elbowed him in the leg (sofltly but who cares) and he pushed me and shit...
They are now having a fight... Well not him but others, god i hate em all omg.
One thing i keep wondering is if i am strong enough to knock someone out? Like i definetly want to sometimes, but *can* i? Of course the following stuff will be horrible, or maybe not? Who the hell knows. If its anything about my identity (or someone else's who knows :3c) then we will be finding out!

I coded a little (idk if i mentioned) before history, and during history we watched a movie, listened to the teacher talk and then rad the book and wnswered some questions.
And im just like really sad rn, like idk if i wanna be trans or nah and its really annoying, i really want to talk to someone :( idk who tho, nobody can realate and best thing they can do is listen :(
Well lets stop with the negativity, i do know *one thing*, i like boys :3 oh and wearing femme clothes, although one thing that is really annoying are thigh highs that go down to your knees after a little while. (mine)
well Niva has just sat down on my table, aswell as veronika (and alwin is also here.) i just wanna tell them all but idk how they will react and if theyll help etc raaahh.
