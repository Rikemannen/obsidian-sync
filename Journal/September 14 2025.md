Idk what i dreamt about.
I woke up early, and fell asleep again. The kid sleeping over was then going to wake me up, and when he went into my room he didnt, he checked out the box with models ive made. I opened my eyes and sat up, and he wasnt looking so i threw Femmy (omg i actually wrote that :O) at him and he jumped like crazy.

We ate small pancakes for breakfast, and for lunch we ate pancakes at the pancake place. They tasted like flour, well not really, but they werent good. There were also another family there with us and i then went and played with them after the other two left. I drove an excavator, a pedal car and pet a cat, the cat was really nice until you touched a specific spot on its neck, then it got furious.
I also wore my thigh highs the whole time there >:3

Im starting to think more about getting clothes and stuff rn. I will buy the sockies that i want when they are in stock, along with matching arm warmers. I then want a skirt soo bad but idunno how to get it. I dont want to shop online and shopping alone is really weird, especially as a guy shopping for skirts lmao. Ive thought of two things, in order from best to "worst" option:
1. Come out to my girl friends in school and go shopping with one of them, really easy to play it off in the store
2. Come out to my mom and same but with her
I do want to wait with coming out to my family until ive gotten a bf or *atleast* know half certainly what i am, rn i cant quite *put my finger on it (laughs as old timer).*
I might actually do it next week, or maybe wait until ive gotten thigh highs? I also want a hoodie btw. This is so confusing and annoying, but yet... so fun. I cant wait! Well i *can*, thats kinda why i havent done it yet. God this sucks.

Well ive been playing mostly ragdoll universe right now, occasionally going downstairs and getting the printer ready for another batch. One game i played there was a guy that had like lvl 800, he seemed nice, and was really good. And i see this as a bit of a challenge to try and kill this guy. Of course i dont just go for him (target). And when i finally kill him i go "yay" and he goes full on angry. After the game he tells me to get better or something before targeting him. And im just like "im just getting stuff and you come so i shoot" and "apologizing" for annoying him. Then he said "i know what im talking about", i said sure you do and (tried to say) "i guess im just a dumbass" but ofc it got tagged. And so i came with the comeback of the year "cant even insult myself in this day and age".
Oh and also there was some guy named "greenboy10b", and my cousins name in roblox is w_greenboy? Ofc its not **the** person, but a coincidence.

Im also kinda tired rn (20:30) and ill go to sleep now.

Shit to do sometime:
Come out (Idk why i wont do it, i did have a perfect moment to with my mom today, but i didnt, i mean itd be obvious in the entry if i did lol)
Get thigh highs & arm warmers (i felt cold today and thats why i want it, ive been wearing thight highs the whole day and im not cold at all on my feet, well a lil but whatever.)
Shave my legs (completely, no hair, i *can*, but im scared of people knowing, i might just do it and keep myself in private yk, i mean who th looks at them at home anyways. Its just that itll probably smell like ass, but ill manage.)
Well get clothes in general, socks, arm warmers, skirt, (actaully) comfy hoodie (hoodies i have are like syntetic or smth idk, i dont like em. i want cotton or smth)
