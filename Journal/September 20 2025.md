I havent written down shit today, idk my dreams, but i know the rest somewhat:

I did nothing today!!! Well i did scroll reddit for a solid 5 hours lmao
Anyways i then showered (i didnt yesterday cuz im a dirty boi) and then we went to our "neighbors" far away to eat shrimp. We played in the yard and i slid and got grass on my pants, uhh i tried to not choose the ones i want on monday but i think i did `._.`
After that we ate, then we went upstairs and played with nerf guns. i felt so cool building the big one and putting it together yk. Then we took some string (my brother, not "we") and built a fucking net with the doors and the staircase's. We then ate ice cream with banana :D
And then i didnt wanna play anymore, i did do shit at the table like spinning the lid of a bottle really fast which was fun. And now we are here, im sitting in a couch journaling. I might go upstairs and sit there or smth idk yet. Until we meet again!
