No Lucid dream, i didnt wake up `._.`
I dreamt about halloween, me, my grandma and brother were going to her place to be there. Once there (it was actually the school fsr) we built some candy sculpture. I dropped ours once but it was fine.

Anyways my mom told me we are going to eat out today and buy a jacket for me. And that just made me not wanna get out of bed fsr. She said shed call the dog to my bed if i didnt and she did but he didnt come. Anyways idk what jacket to buy, i dont really use one but we'll see.

We are on the way to shop now and i just cant stop thinking about yesterday, i am so fucking fucked. On Monday there is a very huge chance that everyone will find out. Oscar will most likely tell everyone he can. Although, he didnt really yesterday, i dont think. But its just what he does. What the fuck do i do im so scared, like i dont want this. Ill have to tell him if he seems like he would do it.

We have now come home. We ate at mister york since there was one where we went, we being me and mom, the others ate china buffet or asia or smth at the mall. The hamburgers were **really** good.
At the mall we bought like 3 tshirts for me and nothing else. I really wanted to tell my mom that i want "girl" clothes (in parenthesis since it shouldnt be gendered but it is :/) anyways i did joke about it when she told me i could get anything, i said "ooh i want that that and maybe that" in the girl section.
Anyways i was really hungry the whole time and not in a good mood. Thats about it ig.

Oh and i read something today, some person said that they couldnt stop wondering if they were trans or not, and someone commented that cis people dont think like that, so they have to be trans *to some extent*. So i guess that applies to me aswell.

Oh i just remembered something. I am sooo fucked for tmrw, i come to school at 8:50, everyone else is there earlier. Everyone else will know before i can stop it. I will have a shit day tmrw :D Fuck i am not looking forward to this one bit.

Alright here is my plan:
When i arrive i gotta do what i usually do, talk to Axel and Frans and just sit at a table looking at my phone. And if anyone asks just remain calm and be like "yeah why" (if its about orientation) and god forbid its about the other thing, remain cool like liquid nitrogen and just say "what about it, cant i be funny?" or something like "ur next" if its the right person. And oh holy mother of jesus, if they are homophobic about it,
ok fuck that, this is kinda related ig, this journal has grown so god damn much it is impossible to find stuff. I wanna find where i say something like "if they are homophobic we will be finding out" after "i wonder if i can punch someone so hard they faint?". I mean that would **really** fit rn. Anyways tmrw might be a really fucking shit day, or just not. If he just shuts the fuck up, its fine. And ofc im doubting it, but i do really want to believe he wont. If he was in the same pickle im fairly sure he wouldnt. But oh well, *i did this to myself and i gotta face the consequences* but no, i really can not tell anyone in this fucking world why the hell i kissed a guy i know will tell everyone i did. Im gonna get bullied big time. Lord let him be sick at home tomorrow, if that so is the only wish i get in life. That would save my ass.

Anyways gonna watch movie now.

Alr ill just start this last little snippet of today with saying that i am sooo fucked for tomorrow. ***~~HOWEVER~~*** I can not tell you a single time where he has done something like this before. Sure he is the kinda person who will, but also, it wont really be the first thing he thinks of, unless those fucking sons of bitches in my class ask how his "birthday party" went. And ive been with them for so long now, that i know that its not gonna be the first thing they think of in the morning. Theyre just gonna play Clash Royale and be bitches about something else. Heck somebody will even sleep in. So im kinda optimistic about all this. But i do fear the worst.

Oh and also i forgot to add yesterday that we talked a lot on the way there about school and the annoying guys. Ill spare you the details but we did, it was fun.

Wait omg nuclear solution:
If they start doing shit, i have shit on them. I have some vids and screenshots and heck even my fucking journal. Ill just release it all. Not that theyd care anyways but i hope it would give them a bad image. A grand exposÃ© if you will hehe.

Oh my god i had more than i thought, i have when they call me gay (ironic) and fat and say i have to kill myself and asking how to hack the school computers and sending "porn" (it includes that stuff but not irl, still counts) in the group chat? And like i said my journal where i... journal :P
Oh and i did do some research, you can not just knock a guy out like in action movies. A simple punch from a fairly weak 14 yr old wont knock someone out, suprise!! Fuck it lemme make a collection of shit to expose cuz why not idrgaf yk.

Unrelated but oh my fucking god i found it, [[August 25 2025]], block 8, it wasnt pepsi max ðŸ˜¿. That is so canon wth. Also towards the end of that, that is so real, everyone will know before summer next year... Everyone will know tomorrow. Nah but shit is close. And i cant *not* wonder if i am the only one? I mean i think that therian in 7th grade is a lesbian, but i might be wrong. Anyways, back to scraping 60 entries for expose material.

[[August 27 2025]] at home part, i just wanna change friend to "friend" or just a guy in our class.

[[August 28 2025]], yea that one wasnt really pepsi max tbh ðŸ˜¿

[[August 29 2025]] idk why i said 9th graders are horrible, they literally just arent, they are so cool fr.

[[September 01 2025]] `._.` just `._.` (the G part) and ofc the little list. minor compared to what is going on now

[[September 02 2025]] OMG did i forget to update? She doesnt like me anymore (thank god, sorry but im so grateful, she will know why soon enough)

[[September 04 2025]] damn my anxiety is bad lmao

Fuck i think my brother has migrane, hes saying ouch and stuff and turning and whatnot omg i feel so bad, ima stop journaling just a sec brb, the time is 22:45 btw

[[September 04 2025]] i just realized i have to remember 8 German States for our test!!! (I set a reminder dw)

On a side note, why tf is the exposÃ© file in my repo now??
Holy shit i just clutched putting my phone away big time there, my mom came to my brothers room, he says he feels like he is gonna throw up, ima shut my lights off at 23:00 cuz it aint dark in here. Nvm no i wont.

[[September 05 2025]] block 10, fomo

[[September 06 2025]] first time linking future entry!

I just had a special little feeling, i felt like it would be nice of everyone knew about me, in a way that would allow me to express myself freely. I wish everyone would accept me...
Forgot to mention, we ate pizza for dinner :P

[[September 08 2025]] that knife dream made me remember that game where there is a spinner that decides if u fight someone, blood drops etc and with rooms and whatnot, i wanna play that again... Also read more of it, im so desperate lol. That reminds me, i bought more of those sticks today from the new amart in Helsingborg. I got 2 chocolate ones. Packs not Singles ofc.

God i keep making sounds with my phone case on accident, and my mom is with my brother now playing some weird music thats supposed to help, i turned off the vibration when typigb on my keyboard, it made some sound. Omg he threw up and is still going, not anymore holy disgusting.

Wait where tf did the file go??

No notes for a lil but damn was i depressed in [[September 26 2025]].

[[September 28 2025]], eh nvm it isnt pepsi max

Fuck, im done, ive checked through all entries, firstly reading a lot, then pretty much nothing, the later entries are larger. I do have an exposÃ© ready now tho. Lets just hope all goes well. Time is 23:57, my mom is with my brother, both are sleeping and they have some woman talking and music. Ima drink and sleep, Ralph Wedersen's. (Auf wiedersehen, i say that sometimes idk why)
I cant push, adding more for new commit.
