No Lucid dream, i didnt wake up `._.`
I dreamt about halloween, me, my grandma and brother were going to her place to be there. Once there (it was actually the school fsr) we built some candy sculpture. I dropped ours once but it was fine.

Anyways my mom told me we are going to eat out today and buy a jacket for me. And that just made me not wanna get out of bed fsr. She said shed call the dog to my bed if i didnt and she did but he didnt come. Anyways idk what jacket to buy, i dont really use one but we'll see.

We are on the way to shop now and i just cant stop thinking about yesterday, i am so fucking fucked. On Monday there is a very huge chance that everyone will find out. Oscar will most likely tell everyone he can. Although, he didnt really yesterday, i dont think. But its just what he does. What the fuck do i do im so scared, like i dont want this. Ill have to tell him if he seems like he would do it.
