I was walking i think and it felt like my right leg was 2/3 the length of the left one. Dont remember anything else.
Another dream was something about a backpack with a shit load of money, i was carrying it onto a hill with a ramp, and then the police came and wanted so i slid it down there. It was from a shopping center or something.

We were at the car meetup today, it was kinda boring, but there were some cool cars and some planes (since it was at the airfield).

I played a ton of sound space, on the same map, tilted, im trying to both beat it with sudden death, sd + speed+++, and just speed+++ with high score. Im hoping that the muscle memory from tonight will be enough tomorrow. I either have to bring my mouse to school, or i play deltarune. And im just as excited as always for whatever reason :D
