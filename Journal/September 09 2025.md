I remember about shopping stuff with trucks, but nothing more.

Alright, the time is 9:47, lets make this quick, i have physics in like 7 min.
Well during woodworking the teacher asked if any strong guys could help carry something, i said "ill try" and turns out we were going to carry material that was gonna get scrapped from the building of a classroom. While we were carrying and going back for more and when we were walking past the music classroom the girls were in the room closest to the "road", the girls including Millie and her friends... and when i walked by the went fucking wild knocking and everything, and she made a heart bro omg. Yea she actually likes me ([[September 02 2025]]). And so im now stressing the fuck out about what i shall say when she actually asks.
I wrote that and then couldnt do anymore since there were 2 people close to me, i am now waiting for the bus. Anyways she was also at the bus stop, and i literally acted like she wasnt there/i didnt know she likes me.

In wood craft whatever another thing happened, i was helping cleaning, and i was using g the brush on Liam, Algot and Vidars table, an Liam asked for it, i gave it and took one from another table so itd be quicker. Well he got mad because, Lord forbid, a couple of wood pieces landed on his shoe ðŸ˜® He started throwing the fucking wood things at me (wood pieces from planing) and calling me stuff, i just fucking gave up and threw the floor brush back where it was supposed to be (i was also sweeping the floor) and then just say at my seat. The teacher told us to help a guy cleaning, i heard, and didnt help. If he had looked at me again i wouldve started crying bro, i was on the verge of tears. I keep thinking of just punching those ppl bro they fucking suck.

Well idrk what else to write, ill say im pretty paranoid that someones reading this behind me or smth lol.
I did bring the brownies, they were cold asf, and when i went to give the first guy one he got 3 since they were stuck together. I also gave to the girls that have their lockers around mine the rest after lunch.

During lunch i sat with Vidar and Erik, and when Erik had left, we started taking a bunch of lemons (we used like 11 total) and pressing them into a glass to drink. It tasted like ass. Sour asf

I played Islands at home, like only that, building oil stuff and selling stuff. And then i got bored and opened my Island publicly, and it was fun, i goofed around buying grass for millions etc. I probably wasted about 75 million in items. And i also sold my cauldrons for some items, one guy said i got scammed, but it seemed valuable so it was fine. And the person who traded me also gave me a billion coins like wth. I had fun.

Now that the sacred book has to be returned, i decided to read the rest, bad idea. It took me more than an hour, which means that the time is now 00:14. Everything past the lunch stuff was written at this time. Anyways holy shit the book is good. I need to watch the series more, but i chose the perfect book to read since it is pretty much were i left off. Anyways i have now idea on how to return it. But as they (kinda) said in it, idrc anymore.

My parents (mightve been just mom idk) were at a parent meeting in school today, they talked about the one week of work we have, the buses we gotta pay for (some of us) etc. I dont remember the details, but later we drew the dream school lunch room or whatever and complained about the current one. And ofc i also thought about coming out, but yea ill wait til i get a boyfriend, as someone said, its much easier to come out if u have one.

And there are also some mysterious ass sounds outdoors, well anyways ima try to sleep now, and well ill succeed, but Oh god i will be tired. Im also really stressed (well not really ill just read the room and maybe come out) about the situation in school. I pretty much have 3 options
- Tell her the truth, and have everyone knowing within a week
- Say im not looking to date or similar, best one after first one, maybe, maybe not
- I forgot third one but i think those are my options.
It can literally happen any day, tomorrow (today), a month or never. Either way, this time around, the last one is best, wouldnt have been that two years ago.

If any of you annoying fucks are reading this for whatever reason. Go fuck yourself ðŸ¥°
