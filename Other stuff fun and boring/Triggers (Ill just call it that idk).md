So i have experienced some things that just disgust me or whatever in weird ways for weird reasons, SO HERE IS A LIST!!!
## Structure:
Entries have structure (:O) here it is:
#### Header, short summary
Description, may include if it is something like a touch or something i see and other notes.
- Examples (i might write if i come up with them, doesnt always happen)
## Entries
Here they are :) (well idk if thats a :) thing but sure)
#### Clothing tags
Especially those that itch (me) or stick out (others)
- The tag of the shirt/jacket the woman wears on the image on the book for history class (specific af)
#### Small remains
Plates that are scraped clean with a fork or something but still have remains on them that cant be "picked up", i always get the same picture, a plate with a very thin layer of ketchup on it. A sub-thing to this is licking cutlery, mainly plates (might go into next entry).
#### Cutlery
This doesnt trigger anything per say (well a little but not the main thing) however i refuse to/dislike:
- Use the knives at home that arent meat knives
- Drink out of the glasses in school (i have actually started doing this :D)
- Put cutlery against my lips
- Big spots with fat or whatever on glasses after people have drunk
