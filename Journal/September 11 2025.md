Idk what i dreamt about, mightve been something about building buw idk.

Yay bus journalling ftw
I hate when i gotta start journalling, but whatever, during pe we ran/jogged/walked a bit and then did whatever we wanted, i played volleyball as always, and i did pretty good (imo).

During math i got bored and started writing py on the calculator, i then showed the teacher, and he took a bit of it up on the board, i then started, along with others, memorising them, i got the whole upper row and 2 more, that means i know 27 (?) digits!

The goal for tmrw was 30, 3 included, and for next week was 100. Mf i got 111 before tmrw. I can do it after some times, but this is my pb, no music, laptop keyboard.

Anyways i forgot to mention (a lot of stuff) that i did return the book today, and i did it with Melvin, and he understood what book it was, while we were still in the library he asked if i read it, i said no ([[September 09 2025]] ü§®). When we came out of the library idk what he asked or anything but it led to me saying i brought it home. üòê Shit. Before he could ask anything i said i read it, he asked if it was good, i said it was REALLY good. He also asked if it was a book about love, bro tf u mean, "heartstopper"?? And he was like "well it could be about someone stopping someone elses heart" lmfao. Anyways he can probably piece one thing or another together at this point, itd be stupid of he didnt know.

When i was down watching tv with my mom she said once again (idk when the last time was) that i should cut the hair on my sides üò≠. Well this time i said no, and she started moving it behind my ears, took a pic and holy shit was i cute. God i NEED long hair.

Idk what else to write, i afked in islands today, i got like 148 cry iron.

Ive also been feeling body dysmorphia today, about my voice and whatnot. but also euphoria?????? Does this mean i am enby??

Anyways ima do more pi stuff and then sleep. Until we meet again. Nvm im too tired...
