Uhh, i woke up, and then i pretty much immediately fell asleep, with the intention to Lucid dream, although i think it was just a normal dream since i didnt have control per say, i more so followed with. It started by imagining my room, then going out of it and downstairs, checking my hand to see if i was still Lucid, it went from 5 to 6 and back a lil all the time. I then went to the toilet and tried to see myself in the mirror as a girl, Yeah that didnt work. I then woke up for real.
This wasnt a Lucid dream :(
Although i did try the stuff i wouldve (last part :P)

I also dreamt about watching those guys's new movie that they released a couple days ago (ijustwanttobecool) and it being shorter than 2 hrs.

Anyways ima try to journal as much as possible today, cuz why not. This will be the longest entry i have made so far, i just know it :P

Also, ive really been thinking about the stuff in [[Fuck it, journalÂ²]]. And idrk what's like stopping me or whatever. This shit is so hard :|
During the morning stuff talked about like wel idk i fforgot, probably wasnt important. fuck there was something that happenedgodo i keep getting distracted and whatnot, anyways during crafts just now duing the cleanup i went around with the trash bin and took wood chips or whatever directly from the tables, and once i came to Liam's table he got mad at me for doing it >:(
I fucking hate him and every single guy on this sch- wait no but like half the guys in our grade, they are so fucking annoying, and you cant get them to stop either. Anyways i really wanna try to journal more today like i said at the beginning but i probably cant since short day and we have physics now, which means no journaling and then pe whic, yet again means i cant journal.

Hehe we have physics now with substitute and we are "reading", im doing the things we should with the book for swedish and now im journaling cuz why not. As soon as i come caross the fwew poeple in this book that are homosexual or trans or whatever i get that like heart attack yk, i love this so much, or not idk its just fun ig. Journaling like this is also very fun..

WAit omg i just remembered something, yesterday (night) i cahanged my alarm volume as to hear it and wake up in the middle of the night, but i never set the alarm... im so dumb lmao.

We had baseball during pe and we ran 3 rounds around the football pitch where we played baseball, it was pretty annoying, after that we ate pasta and bacon sauca or wahtever  and then i went to the like tv yk in that room in the food cort and played some furry yt videos and played it off as nothing and then some top 5 op 5 honorable mentions.Im so weird, and to add to my weirdness, during lunch the others started mixing some potion with passta and ketvchup, milk water and whatnot, they said that the guy who drinks it (i sat with adam, alvar and their friends yk) and well they said who drinks it gets 3000 money, i acted like i was gonna do it. And then they said that whoever drinks it got a femboy bf, i drank it lmao, im so fucking weird oml (and gay :3)


oh and when i come home ima get those girls who want laser engraving there, and after that ima go to that place again and hangout with the other people, and ima bring the wii controllers and play wii sports or something, that would be fun. I just got a notification from my phone from r/teenagersbutcode???? i did fix that tho now :D

Idk why i keep pushing the things but i do, ill still access on laptop later anyways :) (ironically i didnt push that lol)

Yay the guys are now banging on the wall :D
Ignas was first out
Ignas is now asking if he can knock on the wall once if he does the thing he should in the book, everyone does the same `._.`

We now have 12 minutes to "work " on the computers, nobody wil :P

Omg after we quit German and were walking up the stairs to my locker and whatnot, i got stuck with my foot and my "shoe" went off. I got it back and laughed about it, and then Algot started messing with me about it or whatever, i took the shoe and smacked him in the head with it (stupidest thing ever), and then he started going after me just to pin me to the lockers and push me. If i had a weapon, yes this is probably weird or maybe not, i wouldve used it, no kidding. I am so fucking tired of these guys rn.

I did get my cable back that Oscar had forgot to give me, which was nice. Yay ok so im now at the place i talked about, and its pretty nice here, i shared some brownies and isak said they were the best brownies he had ever tasted, i gave him 2 :)
Anyways the girls were here like i said (well at home not here*) and it was awkward asf, i didnt ask all question i wanted cuz i just talked a shitload about stuff they didnt care about, and i really didnt come out as nice to them tbh, i mean they didnt mind but DAMN, i really dont know how to talk to ppl.

Anyways i bought frozen pancakes for lunch along with cookies and a pepsi, kasper was with me and bought candy and christmas drink or whatever lol. I dropped the cookies once and then poured them out on a plate and microwaved, i then shared them. After that i played around and backed up my flipper and whatnot. I then ate pancakes with jam that they had, i ate 4 out of 16 and said others could take the rest, i really need to stop being so nice. I then did some stuff and then went back to the store with ludwig (i think its what his name is idrk) and bought chocolate like buttons. I shared them aswell and here we are :)Uhh a kid wanted to see what i did so im typing privately now :P any

Uhh yea im thinking that during the events they have later ill probably find some cute guy, i know this is a LOOOOONG shot but damn, i need one :3
Im probably also gona come out to theese people firstly, like nobody else really before, they are realy ince and well they have like signs with rainbows (you can guess why :P)
I lvoe it here :P
I just went out and follow uhh.. uhh wtf is his name?? i followed him home anyways, halfway, i didnt go over the big road. I asked him if hes gay since he said some stuff like well come home with him and something else idk, he didnt respond and so i told him not to avoid the question and he said yes (ofc) and i said me too!! Hes kinda fun :3

Alright days over, i did not come close to beating my entry length but whatever. The last few things were me checking Steam sale and talking to Filip and he told me about how he biked close to my house, well the village, when he went there to be with the people yk. And i told him about how it takes 20 min and whatnot. Before that tho i was journaling in secret and he came up and literally saw that i used Linux and said i have a good career ahead of me ðŸ¥¹
God i just fucking love being there with them. Its literally the best thing in my life rn. He also talked a bit about what they were gonna do on friday, remember friday = 23:00 and fun stuff. He said there was gonna be karaoke, and im just so excited to sing my heart out, even tho i hate my voice ðŸ«  I cant really talk, let alone sing, like a girl yet, but i wasnt planning to.

On the way home i fantasied about having a bf riding with me and hugging me rahhh im so lonely, but damn is that thing there nice. I cant stop going now. I also really wanna wear like fem clothes to it someday, that will most likely be the first place where i wear fem clothes and come out etc. I just feel so safe there yk. Oh and on Friday we will also get to play in the gymnastics house or whatever!!

Anyways im tired, but not as tired as im gonna be on Friday!! (Oh and my mom said i did get to go! We are having cousins over, the annoying ones, so thats awesome.) I did not come close to journaling lots today, but i did get a lot of details imo. This was my day, stay tuned for tmrw!!

Some little more stuff here unorganized:
Oscar got my very good butterfly knife and brought it to school ðŸ˜‘
I sang on the way home (antihuman by Ivy if you must know) and it was fun, i also talked to myself.
I spend a little to much money to be nice to ppl
Im tired and going to sleep, gn! (No Lucid dreaming today)
Oh have i bit mentioned, Oscar has created a group with some guys to play Laserdome, im in it, and its literally just for spamming. The other guys sent like feet and weird images and actual porn, idk why. Anyways we have yet to decide a date and how to get there etc, and its gonna be next weekend.
