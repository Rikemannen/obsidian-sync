I dreamt about doing puzzles to get somewhere in a huge city, some where electricity, some were like wood.

You know th- nah im jk ive just come home after school rn.
Im gonna try to change my routine a bit. Well anyways i cant really write about anything at home rn since, well, i havent been at home for more than 10 min.

I never know where to start when i write this so ill just write whats most interesting
Firstly, during swedish class i was really bored. So i tried to see my phone with scrcpy, well it worked yay! Anyways i then went to help the people on the table next to mine (guess who they were!) and well i just stayed with them after that. Of course they made some jokes like asking me if i was a femboy or gay. Well i did answer "yes of course" but im pretty sure they think im joking and just playing along. Well what do i know?

During english class we had hw, i tried to learn all of it and well i *did*, but i just got half of it all. The other ones were past present whatever tense of some words, i got 3 wrong (one line with the same word, i got the wrong word since it didnt say word in english). We then watched the truman show again and its **soo** good bro. Well mission impossible is better yadda yadda but its a good movie (god i need to rewatch m.i.), i really wanna watch movies rn lol. There is also a song that i got stuck in my head for a day, its called "philip glass - anthem, part 2". I also thought about maybe just not paying much attention to the movie (its impossible, really) so that i can watch at home without disturbances cuz its just so f'ing good. I love it bro. Im pretty sure ill rewatch it at home anyways.

We ate chicken for lunch (guess who i sat with at lunch! (idk why this is so cool bro, i guess cuz i have guaranteed non-homophobe friends, who knows)
Ima bake brownies tomorrow, i cant be arsed rn, im so lazy omg.

Well i played some naval warfare, it was fun, but we were like 10-15 in our team. 2 people were actually talking. We couldnt get shit done. During my last one i also found out we arent eating at home, except we are meeting those garlic people. And of course they "had told us today, yesterday and two days ago". If that was the case, that would be written in [[Journal/September 05 2025|September 05 2025]] [[September 04 2025]] or [[September 03 2025]]. Find it? Nope thats right. (I do have a vague memory of them mentioning it, but that was just saying it existed.)

And to make it even worse, i was mad i couldnt find the bag for my power bank. My mom helped me search, when we got into my room i told her it doesnt matter. Nah she kept looking, at this point she had checked next to my desk. And of course she didnt stop.
- Opens right drawer
- I get heart attack
- I smack the drawer closed and told her it doesnt matter
- fuuuck (long story short, [[August 25 2025]], [[August 27 2025]], guess where my dumbass put the book)
Yea well it is, like ive said in [[August 25 2025]], just a matter of time before everyone knows. We were like i said at that food thing today, and Ville was with us (along with others ofc). And i promise, as soon as i tapped my phone and his eyes saw my background, he said "yadda *femboy* yadda" ðŸ¤¯ Bro its not even funny anymore everyone **will** know, before *i* even know it.

I also saw a post about someone hating people that fake mental illnesses for clout, and that got me thinking, what the hell do i have/what is *"wrong"* with me? Cuz i feel like im guaranteed to have something unordinary, but i dont want to upset people like that because of something i dont know.

Another thing in school was that i connected to my pi via tunnel (idk why i mention that but sure) and i turned on the ngrok tunnel for the site, and well, it just worked... the person sitting next to me in english (Lilly) said it was cool ðŸ¥º

I also thought about getting hollow knight (the new one), but it doesnt feel like something for me, but i still want to get it for some reason, even though i dont really believe ill like it. Idk man.

Anyways i have nothing planned for tomorrow so i guess ill bake or cry or do nothing idk. Im gonna sleep like crazy rn. Also idk if i might start writing down what my dreams are based on, since ive noticed in the past, most, if not all, of them are based of off 2 things that happened that day/week/whatever. Im still not gonna write down the weird things tho (But i havent had any for a while, i cant really remember when i did... :D?)
