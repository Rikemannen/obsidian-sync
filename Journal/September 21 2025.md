I forgot my first dream but my second one was waiting for someone to cook something so that we could do something to some rich people with it...

I just got up and put on clothes and i did pick the right pants yesterday, the ones i have now are the ones i want. Ill try not to get them dirty (impossible)

Alright so we were just away shopping for groceries and other stuff. And i didnt get my pants dirty!! We also ate at some burger place ive never been on, it was pretty good. The tables were made of wood (and the chairs) and there were nicks and grooves in them. I tried pressing against it with my nail and i could draw in it, so i drew a boykisser :3
Well almost fully but my parents got mad for "ruining" the table. That is literally the opposite of ruining, besides, the tables already had spots so...

Ima code or smth now, im also tired asf.

Alright its evening, ive coded a lil, ima shower so that my dad doesnt get mad and then ill write more! :)

journal takes time from reading
i dont like deoderant
stuffy nose
coding
journal strategy

alright ive made some notes on what to write down, ill start with this:
my plan for tomorrow (wearing a hoodie, thigh highs etc, a bit secretly tho) might be screwed. I asked my dad if he had put the clothes i got down yesterday or whatever in the drier, he said "idk". I hope to god that he has, since my t-shirt is there, and i dont feel like i want to really wear the other shirts and a hoodie... god it was such a good plan and now it might be fucked...

anyways ive thought about some things, this is what i remember:
Earlier when i got magazines (THATS WHAT ITS CALLED OMG) i read them pretty much the same day. Now when i get them i kinda don't until i get new ones. And im pretty sure thats cuz i now journal, which i do pretty late tbh. BUT.. i dont mind :D

Another thought i got when changing is that my deoderant actually doesnt smell that good... Id love to have a more *feminine* or smth (idk what to say but im "into" that yk) but that goes against society's "rules" or something. fuck it, im too scared to say i want that kind of stuff instead.

I have also noticed that my ~~right~~ left (i suck at left & right wth) nostril (from my pov) is ALWAYS stuffed to some degree. I can breath perfectly fine but as soon as i try to blow my nose its like a pressure valve that shuts closed. The other nose is perfectly fine.

And talking about body, here is some more:
I hate my right ear, it may look like just the tip or whatever is weird, and thats what ive thought for a long time. But i have realized (not now but a while ago) that the WHOLE EAR CANAL IS DEFORMED (well ok not really, but the outer ear is **not** regularly formed) **and here's my proof**:
When i try to have my headphones (earpieces) in my ears, the left one fits perfectly, but i just can not get the right one to feel the same, it either feels twisted, popped out and usually almost "jumps" out of my ear if i move a bit "too much".

I also want to make a skin routine for myself to get rid of pimples or whatever in my face (which i am starting to get, probably acne or whatever idk) and also start shaving for real, face, legs and "other spots" (tummy aswell!)

Uhh anyways thats alot of "complaining" or whatever, here is what i did today:
Morning i ate pancakes, then me and my parents went grocery shopping yadda yadda, then i just coded while listening to music. We ate mashed potatoes with bacon in it and those big hot dogs or whatever, ngl it was not good. Oh and ill also mention that ive started getting really sensitive about how others (and i) sound while eating, it gives me chills and stuff sometimes... what is happening to me ;(
After we ate (and during) we watched that tv show with idiots. it was funny as hell.
After that i coded some more and then showered and now we are here (or rather were i started this bit but whatever)

~~One~~ two other thing ill mention is that i might change the way i journal a bit, im probably not gonna do this always but sometimes if i feel like it:
When i am out and about ill write down some sentences about what i am doing, just to remember, instead of writing abotu the whole event, when i can just do that later. Of course its still fun to write in "secret" in school, but in social gatherings like being over at someones house ([[September 20 2025]] ðŸ‘€) ill just write a little to then elaborate when i am free. i will (most likely) never stop *LNJ* tho :P

And finally, i feel like i have *some* kind of thing, i mean like *neurodivergency*, **i am not certain at all whatsoever** but i do feel like my behavior is a bit strange... **YOU KNOW WHAT!?** [[Triggers (Ill just call it that idk)]] Ive thought about doing it and here it is! Also another note is that today when we were shopping, i could not stop touching **everything**, i told my mom i did it to have something to entertain as many senses with, and i told her i didnt just want to see things, i wanted to touch them (2/5) and eventually i figured out i also knocked at stuff to *"pleasure"* my hearing (3/5) (smell and taste are hard, i sometimes smell stuff but i cant "summon" it). idk why i do this, i guess because its fun. idk if this is something "real" or im just being annoying but it is me ig :)

And ill leave it at that, ima scroll reddit now! (i might end up adding more, oh well)
