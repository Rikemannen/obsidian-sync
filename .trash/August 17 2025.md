I was walking i think and it felt like my right leg was 2/3 the length of the left one. Dont remember anything else.
Another dream was something about a backpack with a shit load of money, i was carrying it onto a hill with a ramp, and then the police came and wanted so i slid it down there. It was from a shopping center or something.
