I forgot to push dream stuff, oh well.
I have swedish class in like 5 min, im sitting in the classroom rn, it is calm af in here lol.
Ive had german, we had hw but i knew most of them, and besides it was on the board today. But the teacher said something that made me react. That the words arent graded based on if we know them or not, except they are graded in the way where he checks our tests later and sees if we include them or not. I *might* have to get better at doing my hw...
We then had math :D
I wrote down 108 digits of pi, i got the last two wrong, but that's since i didnt really know them, i just guessed. When the class ended i managed to forget my laptop since i wrote on the board the last thing i did and thought i had all my items. Well i ran back and took it, it was embarrasing af.
And now we have swedish, im trying to learn 150 digits of pi rn.
