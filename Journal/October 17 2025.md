I dont remember details about my dream, however i do know that i once realized in the dream that i was in a dream by doing a reality check `._.` but that doesnt mean i had a lucid dream. What i remember is that there were like rooms and you had your own, kinda like the game social experiment... God i wanna play that again. I also dreamt that i had bought pride flags for my room, one rainbow yk and the other idk, trans maybe?
Anyways i also sung happy birthday for my mom 

Ok some things i have forgot to mention the past days, yesterday at the party there was a guy named max there, and when i showed videos to the others, he always spoiled what the joke was etc if he recognized it... And ive also listened a little to the pi song 2.0 and it seems like i know it now... Yay!

Oh and why do famous people keep dying this year? We had people during summer and today we had Ace Frehley from kiss, damn.

I started with my routine, duh, i also measured the manure, it was cold af outside too, however measuring the temps wasnt all too bad this time. After that we moved a pasture and i figured out a revolutionary technique of putting a fencing stick on the wires and then dragning that along, putting it in the ground and setting another stick next to it where you want it, and then keeping in going. That made sure the wires are at the correct height and not jumbled together.
After that me and Otto went and picked up some sheep close to the golf course. And then we are eating now, and we are gonna eat chocolate cake later.

We are now gonna eat cake, i kinda already know it isnt gonna be that good, but whatever, i have so far been just putting mud on the walls, we are doing the last one directly on the plank now. My thumb also hurts like crazy.

Nvm the cake was pretty good lol, i ate 3 pieces, Adam ate 2.5, Otto 1.5 and anna 1

Home at last. Now is this good enough for a journal about my days? Nah they're gonna say that its not cuz its english... ofc not since they dont gaf and wont read this either unless i maybe let them but oh well. (In that case hello, or, tjenis penis vad tycks om journalen?)

First time writing swedish, i hate it fsr.

At home we ate meat fries and pink sauce, it was real good. Before dinner i sat in the couches learning pi, i could do 300 of them at the end, well almost, i need guide from music somewhat. [[September 11 2025]] was the last time i did it, that was 112 digits, an increase of 188 with just a few more hours of training and just singing the song. Im still having trouble with the last 100 like i did with 101-200 before, so ill probably learn it :) i mean im gonna keep trying just today, and when pi song 4.0 comes out ill learn that one too.

Anyways we also watched that test program today, a new season, it was real fun however i only laughed when nobody else did.

Oh and i took some online tests aswell cuz i was bored, that was before doing the pi stuff. I did one for ASD and one for... ASD? Hehe one was Anxiety Stress Depression test and the other Autism Spectrum test (ASD=that+Disorder). I got:
- 6.33% less stressed than the average person.
- 3.67% less anxious than the average person.
- 21.57% more depressed than the average person.
and the second one:
- Shit its only an image, sooo....![[autism-spectrum.png]]Yay first time doing that. Anyways idk what to say, social difficulty is very expected, flat speech, sure, anxiety, yeah, and i guess (most) others are just default, idk how to understand it or whatever but yeah thats it, i did answer neutral for most of them, and just -1 or 1 for most, they range from -2 to 2, 0 is neutral or skipped.
Anyways idk what else to say, i might do more, i did do a sexual orientation test and the results were like 42% and 49%, omg that was really it? nah cant have been, 42 49 (hex) = BI (ascii) lol. Anyways *kinda* changed ig, but again i didnt really read into the questions. (Masc, Fem in that order btw) oh i can check, 42% 47% were my results.

Oh and i also did an iq test just now, i got 121??? "- **Which makes you brighter than 92% of the population.**" like holy shit i am a fucking hivemind.

Oh shit when i bring this up in class to read my journal the image will be there, ill just fix that pretty quick by making a separate file lol.
