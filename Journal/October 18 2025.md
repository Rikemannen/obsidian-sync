I was at some competiimtion course where you did different things to get points, the things were weird such as pressing. A lithium battery... I also got to be with like a family there.
I also has one where i just say with my brother playing "test music" from a game. I also remember laying in a couch with someone Esping the same thing in one in front of me.

I ate pasta for lunch, ill just say that.
And today i have recited pi a little, and then i organized my downloads folder, well emptied it really, there is nothing left, and i also started playing liminal industries, i did die however, twice. First world i died in i just started a new one with keep inventory on, and then i died there with no bed... and my base is like 1k blocks away which is hard to get to in the backrooms... I did some nbt hacking and revived myself so i didnt have to travel, but the modpack is a bit much anyways...

Holy shit im so mad rn, i did a "test" on how fast i could "type" by choosing custom on monkeytype and then just typing asdf like 10 times, and then repeating that really fast, and now i have fucked up my graphs... god i hate this so much, i reset my personal bests thinking that would fix it, hell nah, that just reset my bests and didnt touch that, now my graph has a jump up that cant be removed. I guess ill just have to type 200wpm once... or atleast over 188... my pb is 150 btw.

Holy shit i added all songs that ive saved in the background on my phone to a yt playlist and downloaded it, and some songs are just BANGERS. Like holy shit, in fact so good that i have now created [[Karaoke Song List]].

Oh and why didnt i mention, i also did a "short" typing test, i did laptop keyboard + touch typing, i got 45 wpm! Oh sorry the test was 30 min :P Next one is 1 hour, i will probably someday.

Oh and i liked my 2000th video on yt today, but the 3 earlier ones were better :P (im not gonna say which ones that is)

For halloween idk what to do, i asked my dad if we had a reflective green/yellow jacket thing and he said no, my idea was that, some working pants or whatever and a pylone on ma head :P
Im still doing the pylone and i thought about getting arm warmers and thigh highs in orange or smth, but angypaws's ones are sold out :( well what did i expect lol.
THE PYLONE IS STILL ACTIVE THO! I will be wearing a pylone.

I haven't mentioned but im looking forward to school like crazy, BUT ITS ONLY SATURDAY NOO. Yeah it sucks :/
I also wanna tell everyone that i now know 300 digits of pi, here they are btw:
