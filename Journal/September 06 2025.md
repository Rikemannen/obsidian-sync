I was on a boat in minecraft and fishing, it was going really fast. I was also in the woods walking down a path, and i had food, but when it became hard to carry i stores it on my cat like you do in peak??? Well i did write what i said i would in [[September 05 2025]] :)

Holy shit, im journaling this [[September 07 2025]]. The time is 00:40 rn. Anyways today was an eventful day.

Firstly i just want to mention that the dream part today was awesome by my standards (i wont elaborate)
Alright, i ate sandwich for breakfast, after that (not immediately but after a while) we went back to where we were yesterday, this time there were a ton of people selling stuff, i mean its literally a farmers market. The people we were with yesterday were also there, selling garlic or buying stuff. (except for one kid and the other family's dad) We ate hamburgers (again) and then bought garlic and tomatoes. After that we went home.

At home we had to clean the house. And i did some mayor fuckups. When nobody was looking i took the stuff i had in my couch and put them in the bag again. And then put them in the cart next to my desk?? What was i thinking. Ofcourse, a bit later when my mom had tipped the flowers i put on the cart, out i told her i was missing a part (i wasnt) and she look around the cart and felt the god damn bag, and she did it twice?! The face thing's pump thing can be felt really easily, so she definitely felt it. She most likely thinks its x and i use it to y... She didnt look tho! Idk if thats good or bad in this scenario, it would be fine if i didnt have the hair cream in there, but i did... As long as she doesnt go snooping around later.

Anyways after cleaning was done (done=i didnt have to do anything else) i played naval warfare, this time with pc+main and laptop+alt, to control a ship and a plane for the ship. I played with yahya (idk if i mentioned them?) and some other awesome people. But there were some guys who took the big ships when we got killed and drove them the wrong way/out of the map.

After a while we had guests over, our "neighbours", two random people and my brother's friend (theyre going golfing tomorrow with him, he is sleeping over. Now that i think about it, i havent had a sleepover with anyone for years. God im so lonely. I dont *like* it, i *tolerate* it. Nah i just *live* with it.

We ate fried chicken for dinner, and some chocolate cake for dessert. I loved the chicken but not the cake. I dont like cake. It was chocolate cake thing that i bake sometimes, with some chocolate spread and chocolate shards (?) and some milk chocolate things. Basically just chocolate. (i got hamburger for lunch btw)

The guy sleeping over just said gn to me :D (only my parents do that omg)
Anyways im gonna try to sleep now. I also have my big cover in my bed again, ima be hot like crazy tonight (i mean, hotter than i already am :Ãž)
