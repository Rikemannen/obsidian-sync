I was in class with ivycomb and we talked about how to pronounce his friends names.
I also ate a brisket or something for lunch, like a whole cow leg. And then me and some mechanic figured out that you had to scan your finger in the tractors to unlock all functions. My cat was also sleeping on the control panel of the tractor we were in, it was a modern john deere. And then there was some other stuff with other people at my school but idk what. It was like stuff such as messing around while the teacher was talking .
Lastly i dreamt about putting down flooring somewhere. 

I have now made my morning routine, i had to fill one sodium and then i also got a makeshift stick thermometer to measure the inside of manure with. I had to take 3×6 tests, 3 per line of manure, 6 lines. It took a while. The average temp was like 50°C.
After that i helped the others move a pasture by picking up sticks and placing them down next to it. I also helped put the wire on the sticks. And turn on the electricity. I then drove the gold cart home with the two last bars of battery blinkning alternating. But i made it.

We also started building on their office right before lunch. We put sand, clay, water and wool in a blender thing and let that go during lunch to make something to put on the walls yk.

The meal was real good today again, spaghetti bolognese :P

We kept building after lunch mixing more mud, the one we started before going eating was perfect. We mixed one new which got way too loose, so we added more sand and wool which made it good. I also took and ate my banana at this point. Once that was done we put it on and i started a new batch before going.
But thats not all i did. I also helped put mud on the wall a bit and cut up netting for putting on the clay and clamping with the clamp-gun or whatever so it wouldnt wall off. But thats about all :)
