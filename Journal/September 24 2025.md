I dreamt about doing a physics test and then talking to people after, i did have something before this but i didnt write down...
I also biked to school that day

That wasnt much uhh, right before i went to school my mom said that she and my brother were gonna go shopping for clothes, and asked if i wanted to sometime, i said yes and now im wondering if i should tell her? That'd mean i get what i really want.Right before we started the day in our home classsrom i played some rt3, and i stressed like crazy to get all customers out before we started at 8, and she called (teacher[C[C us in earlier so i played in the classroom too, but i managed to get the restaurant empty 5 seconds before
God we are doinga a text of some kind rn in history and we are supposted to write if the source is good or bad, it sucks, idk what to write on the things :(
Valter also reacted with "What the hell are you writing" when i was writing this.
Yay i forgot to journal!!! Anwyays we ate lunch, it was noodles and chicken wok, i sat with niva and veronika since we had goofed around in the line in and everyone else i knew had left me ;)
We went from the food court 10 min before our class started. During art we drew and i made some bricks on my image, i am gonna start coloring next week. And when class was ending and we were collecting all pencils again i wanted to leave so i started looking for them, and i didnt find them, turns out some other girs from 9th grade had them, and theteacher said that i could leave since i was the only one who was looking for them :D
Right before german stared we went into the spanish classroom and goofed around (i love saying goofed lol) and then we went twhen they didnt want us there. But right before we did the teacher said he would get the principal if they knocked, and i said "YEA DO THAT!", he didnt hear tho, i dont think he did but whatever.
So im gonna try to write down the people that do knock later on :P
