Well we had math just now, and i did like 5 things, it was about circumference of a circle and stuff. And I also saw that Niva had a pink hoodie, holy shit it is cool, i want one so bad (like i said in [[September 17 2025])
Anyways Veronikahadnt overslept, she was apparently sick. But that doesnt really matter now anyways...
Well we have history now, i am **not** looking forwarto it :/. We are (probably) going to present our presentations we made last week, the one i didnt do anything on and the one i was with did most of the work in. We begin now, i will write more later!
I was wrong we do not begin now, in five minutes. Yea its really hard to write while not seeing anything AND with one hand (i was standing up just now) But it is pretty damn fun
Uhh idk what this document looks like rn.
Uhh oscar just asked me what i was writing, thats real funny lol, i showed him the masked output and he said "ohhh thats a lot" or something i forgot. Anyways David came with some bolt cutters or whatever now, someone has forgotten their lock/key :O
Idk what more to write, we start in 4 min, it is really funny to write like this, no matter what people do (except try to heck my keboard presses which is near impossible) they can not know what i am writing!! I can even do it in the classroom since nobody can proove im not just typing othing randomly to troll. And well as long as i clear the initial output its impossible to know.
Valter just checked what i was doing, he doesnt seem to care tho.

We just got info from the pe teacher that he is going to the dentist and we are starting it later, and we are checking our rsults of orientating (is that correct???) from the mountain thing yk, (put link here!!) And we are also ging to have initial time to play volleyball (yay) and pingpong (among others ofc).
We just finished hisory now, i didnt have to present ours! only 3 people had to, one group with italy only and two other randomly chosen ones.  We now have break for like 25 min which is very nice, we ave swedish next btw. Well idk what to write rn ubt thats a bout it ig.$^
Oops i typed command there lol

Ivenow added a raw command feature to my script so i can run os commands! It actually works with user interaction and stuff, and i can run for example fish in it to use fish, and then when i exit that i come back to python! Yea  i just think this is so cool.

Well we had lunch now, we ate soup. Before lunch however when i was walking to my locker to put my laptop in it i got smacked in the head by Liams pingpong racket, it hurt :( well it doesnt anymore tho :)
Before we could even get into the food court or whatever i played/watched pool in the room next to it.
Ill continue later but for now ill mention that jamie wait..
I just showed him and he was suprised like crazy, he also asked if i was hacking and i subconsiously said "yea", hehe hes funny.
Anyways i played pool there and then (they screamed i forgot where i am) uhh well i played pool and it took ages to get in since there were poeple before and a long queue, but yea i eventually got in, sat with the guys i usually sit with and then went and now im writing tihs :P
We have pe after this like i mentioned but idk what to do while i wait, so im just journaling. I do wanna talk to the girls but idk where thye are ;(

Yea ima go now and talk to someone or something :)
