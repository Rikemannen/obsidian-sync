Yeah idk what i dreamt about, it wasnt pepsi max ðŸ˜¿ (why do i have that as auto correct??) i didnt Lucid dream, my alarm was way to quiet to wake up.

Today i did basically nothing, i talked with the people who want engraving some more.

We then went to our grandma along with all our cousins and took images there and just ate food yk.
The others were saying stuff about me being ugly while we were taking the pictures, i dont like it :(
Idk why they do it, i just take it as a joke but i really dont want to. Ive just started feeling a bit better about how i look, and then they say that.

Anyways im still hungry rn, im gonna go shower and whatnot.

My mom called me and my brother downstairs to tell us that the youngest cousin thinks we are being mean towards him when we tell him to stop, i just ingore him but he really cant just call down. I told my mom "He doesnt know how to act without a tablet in his hands." Which is true for a lot of ppl today from what ive heard.

Also, notice how i dont journal that much on weekends, nothing exciting really happens :(
