I was driving a tractor at home and was doing certain things with it to get certified or whatever. For example driving to a point. Only issue is i couldnt do some since i had a wagon with me. At the end i.gave up and drove into a pile of wheat to slow myself down some i was going somquickly and couldnt brake 
I was on a green made of sand and was helping some sports guys pack it with sand, well suddenly a komodo dragon appeared on it and they called to report it, i asked if i could have it but "it was endangered".

Yay i have now made a program that makes other people not see what i type!!! My friend is literally sitting next to me and cant see what im typing. Anyways we have german now!

Today during, or well between two classes i think it was, idrk rn, anyways Niva asked me if i was gay, in a joking kind of way, and i just responded yes. I just wanted to say that :P
And since Veronika was sick i was pretty much with her for the first half of the day, during math she asked me to come to her like 2 times and just gave me nonsense questions. God i love hanging out with her like that, idrk how to phrase this but yea its fun that *someone* listens to me :)

One downside with this program is that i cant see if i misspell something, i think i just did but i dont know for sure, i will have to fix later. But atleast nobody can see me what im typing!! Yea this is fun lol.

We ate meatloaf today, it was pretty good. After that, during the break i played ping pong with the other girls that were there, i suck at it... (*"with the other girls"* makes it sound like i am too :3c)

During art class we continued drawing on our folder fronts or whatever, and i feel like i forget stuff to draw on mine, for example, i have now started drawing the bricks on it, but i forgot that i might've wanted a background, well i checked the one that was next to me and she had drawn without a background for the letters, directly on the brick that is, so ill just continue mine like it is. But of course once i found that out, we were going to pack up. Anyways i just feel like i generally judge my drawing too harschly.

During English class we wrote about the truman show, and since it was on that app which i cant have on my laptop, i had to type on the other laptop with a goofy ahh keyboard. Anyways i wrote ~514 words. I also added that he would have had it hard to get a citizenship, but then Melvin said that he would have a citizenship since he was born in the us, and so i now have to remove that...

Well we are gonna watch that german movie now, ill have to type more later, well i probably will have the chance to type during it, like i am now... but idk, we will see :)

Oh and now when we started this class, they said that Hampus was welcome back, he had apparently not been here for a while... I wonder where he has been. Oh and the structure of this entry will be fuuuucked lol, i can not see what i am writing AT ALL. I might add a thing where i can click a keybind to see * or something where letters should be, starting of the word or something similar, just to see the structure. Ill add for next class (if i dont forget)
It looks so goofy when i am writing but nothing is showing up on screen, other people must think im crazy rn.

Now when the teacher left all the guys in the class are going knocking. LITERALLY ALL OF THEM!!! Half of the guys went up and started banging the crap out of that fuck damn wall. Bro i wanna snitch so bad on them but theyll know its me. It feels so cool writing this just as they did it and they dont know (they might suspect it but who knows) :3c
Bro the guys are laughing now (not much and the teacher is here) i just want them to get kicked out so bad oml. Wait, they asked for tape earlier to fix books, could it have been a way to get hm out of here? Bro they are so stupid oml.
Now when the class next to our classroom have ended, they were knocking at the wall, and so the guys here went crazy shouting and we cant hear the other people talking, bro i hate this so muchh :(
Class is over now!!

We had physics just a while ago (we arent allowed to use computer during it, and besides, its interesting), and it was so fucking funny bro, the teacher was gonna demonstrate static electricity and he took a cloth and a whiteboard pen and started rubbing them together. And then started moaning and saying he didnt do it hard enough omg. We also talked about how water boils under a high enough pressure (in room temp) And how you cant boil an egg on mount everest (making it harden). Yea we talked a lot about eggs in heat learning or whatever.  We are having a test soon thats why we talk about it, we were also in the renovated classroom today, it smelt good and it was really good looking. But the tables have *already* started getting worn out due to chairs going up and down. And people will most likely start to fill the drawer/cabinets with trash soon, since thats just what they do :/

Im gonna make this script that i am using now to jounal also allow some commands such as switching file, commiting, pushing and pulling from git, opening other files (i forgot if i said that, i will check).

Alright, ive gotten the script working somewhat, one issue tho, i cant run commands (for example sneak peek which shows me the text) and then edit it, since when i press enter (which i have to in order to type a command) it doesnt allow me to go back. But atleast it works, which is the main thing, i can now clear stdout, push and pull from github, exit and get help.
Alright i did have a weird thing where it didnt savve to file until i exited, but i added some paramterer to the file open statement and it fixed! Now it works!
Anyways i will clean up the other stuff i wrote now, my laptop is dying aswell (is that the correct way to spell it? dying or dieing?)
Nvm yes it is it looks correct, dieing looks horrible lol

Alright ive edited the entry, now i just want to say what commands exist etc:
hot"key" (you just type newline and the prefix) is $^
commands:
D, exit
Push, stage, commit, push
Pull, pull
L, clear screen
SP, sneak peek, show clear text
MP, masked peek, show asterisks for everything but some things, ` \n!?."#()'/:-_<>|`
Anyways ima play games now, until later. Btw this was my longest entry before night so far (i believe).
Oh and i also want to solve the issue where obsidian opens the daily note even if its empty, which means i have to delete it again to pull, but thats for another time :P
