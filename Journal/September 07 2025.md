I was going around in a van or bus or whatever, and we had to find food before a storm came, and eat before it was there. After it has come we got out in a new place and repeat. It sounds weird but there was some "structure" to it.

The host comes in on stage and says
-Hello everybody in the audience **AND** welcome to another episode of late night JOURNALING!!!

Before i write more, i just saw a thing when writing all this, while i was checking my played games i noticed Niva (?) was playing some mall game, oh well nothing huge. After writing some games down i saw something familiar... NULLXIETY?? SHE'S PLAYING NULLXIETY??? How to actual fucking hell did she even find that game? I just checked a little more and idk how i know of the game, i thought it was something with entry point but no. Well it might be in game idk.
Whatever, in retail tycoon i saw some really good stores some people built, and with a budget less then what i have in total, images can be found in screenshots folder on pc, i took a lot of them so i can get inspiration for my rebuild.
I got some progress in notoriety, and by that i mean that i now have infamy X. I also tried doing rush hour to get my level back up, but near the end i triggered the alarm. I got into custody, got out of it (2 bp's left) and then carried one of the two blueprints left (the other one was near the van) to the van, and just as i did that (both bots were in custody or downed) i got killed D: 15 min for nothing.
I barely played naval warfare since i got shit teams.
Nothing much in ragdoll universe either, but i do wanna mention that i am terribly good at elimination. I didnt loose a single one. Idrk if it was today or yesterday but i found 2 people and we played in a private server with admin panel and fucked around.
Now for the fun part (i didnt do much in pyro playground or thief life), islands. At first i thought i wasnt gonna do much. But then i went around to some public islands (shops) and found shit to sell. I sold a ton of stuff. I kinda forgot what really, but i profited ~350 MILLION. Funny thing is, you know that wreath that ive had for a handful of years now, yeah the one i thought about selling for 100 million a couple years back. Wanna know the current price? No thats wrong, its 350 mil. that one fucking christmas decoration is worth 350 million.
Main thing i sold were pink sticky gears, they sell for like 18 mil EACH. I also fished and got extremely lucky, getting 3 propellers. Each one sells for 60 MILLION. bro i got 180 MILLION from 30 mins of fishing. I also sold my enchanted diamond for 65 million, and i have 90 unsold diamonds, each selling for ~1.6 mil... thats 144 MILLION!!! And i thought i wasnt that rich/didnt have that valuable stuff. God i wonder what skyjoker (old friend) has going on. God i should talk to him. Will he remember me? Do i still have his discord?
Anyways i also rebuilt the island a bit, moving the red bronze refinery to the surface and connected one copper drill and one gold drill to it. I also upgraded my workbench!! It cost 250 red bronze ingots. And why not mention it: each ingot sells for 600k.. that is 150 million in ingots..... Im also afking at my island to get more. Im hoping for like 100, but i dont think ill get close to that. BUT according to my calculations: i should get a bronze ingot every 150 seconds, over 8 hours afk that is approximately 192 ingots. And ive set the autoclicker to take the items out of the chest. But it holds 270 so its no issue anyways. Ive also got 2 more gold drills and 2 more copper drills going, one copper every 5 sec and one gold every 2 min comes out to: 192 red bronze ingots, 11,520 copper ingots and 240 gold ingots. Yeah something isnt right in the calculations... Ive put extra chests on the other drills tho. Oh and the steel mills are making things too, i think rods.

Anyways forget gaming, other stuff:
We ate chicken for lunch today (again, well not for lunch again but this day again yadda yadda)
Well its pretty safe to say i didnt do any irl stuff today, since i wrote nothing about it. Anyways im excited for school tmrw. Im gonna stay awake for a lil now, and then sleep. (brownies tmrw?? cant promise tho)
