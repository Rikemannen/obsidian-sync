I forgot my first dream but my second one was waiting for someone to cook something so that we could do something to some rich people with it...

I just got up and put on clothes and i did pick the right pants yesterday, the ones i have now are the ones i want. Ill try not to get them dirty (impossible)

Alright so we were just away shopping for groceries and other stuff. And i didnt get my pants dirty!! We also ate at some burger place ive never been on, it was pretty good. The tables were made of wood (and the chairs) and there were nicks and grooves in them. I tried pressing against it with my nail and i could draw in it, so i drew a boykisser :3
Well almost fully but my parents got mad for "ruining" the table. That is literally the opposite of ruining, besides, the tables already had spots so...

Ima code or smth now, im also tired asf.
