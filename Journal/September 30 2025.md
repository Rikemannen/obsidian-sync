Uhh, i woke up, and then i pretty much immediately fell asleep, with the intention to Lucid dream, although i think it was just a normal dream since i didnt have control per say, i more so followed with. It started by imagining my room, then going out of it and downstairs, checking my hand to see if i was still Lucid, it went from 5 to 6 and back a lil all the time. I then went to the toilet and tried to see myself in the mirror as a girl, Yeah that didnt work. I then woke up for real.
This wasnt a Lucid dream :(
Although i did try the stuff i wouldve (last part :P)

Anyways ima try to journal as much as possible today, cuz why not. This will be the longest entry i have made so far, i just know it :P

Also, ive really been thinking about the stuff in [[Fuck it, journalÂ²]]. And idrk what's like stopping me or whatever. This shit is so hard :|
During the morning stuff talked about like wel idk i fforgot, probably wasnt important. fuck there was something that happenedgodo i keep getting distracted and whatnot, anyways during crafts just now duing the cleanup i went around with the trash bin and took wood chips or whatever directly from the tables, and once i came to Liam's table he got mad at me for doing it >:(
I fucking hate him and every single guy ojn this sch- wait no but like half the guys in our grade, they are so fcucking annoying, and you cant get them to stop either. Anyways i really wanna try to journal more today like i said at the beginning but i probably cant since short day and we have physics now, which means no journaling and then pe whic, jet again (its y ik) means i cant journal.
