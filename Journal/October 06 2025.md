Idk dreams and idc either. Holy shit i hope all goes well today. Im doing some Python quiz to occupy my mind

Idk why i cant pull but whatever, during the morning oscar didnt say anything :D that is so fucking nice omg. We also had music, and the teacher got real mad cuz people were talking the teacher got really mad and swore and stuff, "cant you beq quiet for one fucking class" or smth.During physics we got our results from heat test or whatever and i got 25/21 (you get 4 points max fpor last one) and pretty much nobody else got over 20 points???im so fucking good. History was ok today, we talked abotut future jobs and pay and whatnot. During lunch we ate rice and sausage sauce or whatever, it wasnt really good. Anyways we have swedish now.

Swedish went well, im home now, i was a bit crazy on the bus home fsr.
Uhh at home i played some ragdoll universe, and that annoying guy was playing again, i think it was him cuz he was mad af about me "targetting him". Anyways then Niva messaged me asking if i had asked my parents if i could start going to volleyball. I had asked my mom but she didnt really do anything. Oh and before that my dad bought laser goggles, idk if they are the correct wavelength tho but we will see :P
Anyways she also asked if certain things were gonna be on the german test tmrw, it took me some time to understand what she meant. She also had me read her text for that same text about a friend and herself. And that also reminded me to write my own:

> Mein freund heißt Melvin. Er sind 14 jahre alt und liebt Fußball und Mopeds. Malmö FF sind die besten, sagt er. Ich und Melvin spielt oft Computerspiele zusammen. In seiner Freizeit schaut er Fußball. Sein Traum ist es, eines Tages in der schwedischen Fußballnationalmannschaft zu spielen. Für Melvin ist das Wichtigste sein Freunde, Familie und selbstverständlich, Fußball.

And of course:

>Hallo, mein name ist Gustav und ich bin 14 jahre alt. Mein Geburtstag ist am 24 Januar. Ich liebe Computers und Lego. In meiner Freizeit spiele ich Computerspiele und programmiere, aber ich backe manchmal. Mein Traumjob ist ein Job im technischen Bereich. Für mich ist meine Freunde, Familie und ihr Glück das wichtigste.

Anyways that's about it for now, im gonna ask my dad about volleyball.
I just wanna add, holy shit am i happy that everything i was planning for yesterday wasnt required. That wouldve sucked.

Guess what i just did... I sent an email to the volleyball people asking if i can play there. Holy shit this is fun. My mom reacted on it being a group of only girls, but wike was in it before and its just a coincidence ig. And *i mean* i kinda wanna be tha- ill stfu you get it it doesnt matter.
