I dreamt that i was saying outside someones house, and then we had to hide, and so we ran home, but then he was still looking so i went to the attic and his there, he ended up finding me and i kidnapped him when he tried to run, then someone else saw it and so on. Eventually i had captured like 6 people and we went to have some kind of meeting.

I also woke up with cold ass feet today.

You know the deal.
I got small pancakes for breakfast today!!!
We then went to the cows, but i really didnt have to do anything, just scrolling on my phone and watching videos on my laptop (which i brought)
We ate pizza, well i ate a hamburger, i got full af.

At home i played peak, and first climb i did i got to the top, solo, with bing bong. I then played with Appolo but has to go eat mid game. We barely got past mesa. But it was better than other runs so :)

Before going to bed i annoyed my brother, he got mad...

And to top it off i almost forgot to journal altogether!
