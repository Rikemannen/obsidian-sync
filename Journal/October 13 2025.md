I think i first dreamt about some cooking stuff but i forgot to write it down when i was awake. Second thing was on our farm. It started with some weird thing with people over, idk what we or they did. But eventually i got shown a secret tunnel/room where a lot of like small red ferrets or smth had a tunnel built for them to get away to a better place to live ig. Me and some other person were responsible for getting them away. Eventually other found it but by then all of the animals were gone except for a cat. Idk anything else. It was also kind of like a secret so when we heard people we shut off all lights and tried to hide.

Alr so im eating a banana en, we have just been cutting meat and milling it yk.
So the day started with me almost getting late to the bus stop, with our agreed upon time that is, however Anna didnt come for a while anyways. When we came to the farm we started by me and Otto going out with their golf cart and checking the sheep, i also got to drive it a fair bit. (Dont tell the school) Anyways we then figured we should move some of the sheep so he had Adam come with a dog and we moved them and got 3 special ones out. For getting them out we had to go to a place where we could sort them. I didnt do much there... We also had to get a second dog to help. I also got to ride their four wheeler or whatever, it was fun. We then went to check on compost on the way home.

At home we started washing some tables and stuff (aluminium or stainless steel or whatever) And then we ate lunch, i ate my chicken and curry and a pan pizza. We then kept washing and rolled some stuff in and starting working with the meat they had in their cooling wagon.
We did that for a while, i milled the meat and packaged it and vacuumed it. The others sliced and put labels. Eventually someone else came and the guy from the golf course will later.

Im now inside with Anna and making coffee/eating banana. I am probably also gonna drive and give baking soda to the sheep later, since they need that fsr.
Idk what we are gonna do with the radio stuff, yk water measuring and whatnot but i dont think thats for today.

Oh and the smoothie i bought yesterday is pretty damn good.
I hope this is good so far for a journal about the days :P

After that i went with Anna to refill the sodium bicarbonate (not baking powder) and change one battery for the fencing. And after that we thought we saw a sheep that had escaped, but it wasnt :)
We then went back home, talked to the golf guy and i said that i know who vidar is who was at the golf place. We/they then talked about the shitty regulations they set up and how he always gets a complaint because he sets stuff theyre not allowed to do, so now they just say no to all. Btw Vidar had driven a golf cart, so they didnt really follow it lol. I mean i got to drive:
- Golf cart
- Fourwheeler or whatever
- A fucking meat mill
Anyways im home now if you couldnt guess, idk what to do next.
