Writing this [[August 20 2025]] but whatever, i forgot to add (i think this was the date lol) that the, ill call him "homophobic guy" cuz i hate writing names fsr and it kinda fits him, i kinda made a huge thing today imo, here's the story:
We were in physics class and we had just done an experiement about putting soda cans with boiling water in cold water to watch them imploding, well the group that was on my assigned seat had spilled shitloads of water, like a liter somehow, and the girl in the group (well one of them, since it was a girlie-group (lol what) took their computer bag and started wiping the water?? what? well i ran to get paper and dried it up, and then i saw one guy sitting close to the trash can, i told him to catch the paper as i threw it (he didnt), lo and behold the teacher saw it and told me to not do that. And of *course* the homophobic guy just *had* to say:
- Hey do you want me to tell ur mentor?
My (epic) response:
- Shut the fuck up (in swedish ofc)
He said *"sorry"*?!â€½?!â€½?!â€½?!â€½?!â€½ Holy what? idk why he said it if he meant it or no but i have **never** heard him say that word **EVER**.
Holy macaroni i write a lot.

I dont remember much of today (yes its night rn) but what i do remember is during English today, Ignas (:O) figured out you could connect the laptop to the room tv via bt. Wow so cool. Anyways he sent a pairing request, and the teacher, like most of them, didnt read shit on the popup and just clicked accept.

In wood craft whatever another thing happened, i was helping cleaning, and i was using g the brush on Liam, Algot and Vidars table, an Liam asked for it, i gave it and took one from another table so itd be quicker. Well he got mad because, Lord forbid, a couple of wood pieces landed on his shoe ðŸ˜® He started throwing the fucking wood things at me (wood pieces from planing) and calling me stuff, i just fucking gave up and threw the floor brush back where it was supposed to be (i was also sweeping the floor) and then just say at my seat. The teacher told us to help a guy cleaning, i heard, and didnt help. If he had looked at me again i wouldve started crying bro, i was on the verge of tears. I keep thinking of just punching those ppl bro they fucking suck.

Now when the teacher left all the guys in the class are going knocking. LITERALLY ALL OF THEM!!! Half of the guys went up and started banging the crap out of that fuck damn wall. Bro i wanna snitch so bad on them but theyll know its me. It feels so cool writing this just as they did it and they dont know (they might suspect it but who knows) :3c
Bro the guys are laughing now (not much and the teacher is here) i just want them to get kicked out so bad oml. Wait, they asked for tape earlier to fix books, could it have been a way to get hm out of here? Bro they are so stupid oml.
Now when the class next to our classroom have ended, they were knocking at the wall, and so the guys here went crazy shouting and we cant hear the other people talking, bro i hate this so muchh :(
Class is over now!!
