I was cooling meals ok physics or whatever, i was cutting apples, literally just cutting apples. I also used a horrible knife.
quick entry
Before i went with the bus (which was 2 min late due to something, we knew) mom told me that the windmill or whatever is gonna get its wings back today!! She is gonna send videos and stuff.Uhh i didnt get to write there we were going in. I forgot to mentioon yesterday that my dad found a huge mushroom. He sid it was probably mushroom, idk what it is called, theones you normally eat. Anyways he said that hey were goingto test it out.
I told them not to eat it but they tasted it anyways, and then my mom said it started smelling like rotten or something `._.`

Alright we had history, i dont like it, i did finish but i kinda didnt know what towrite more, oh well.
Before starting swedishi, melvin, kaser and oscar played pool, me and oscar won the first one, second game waas me oscar against uhh we played against nicholas melvin, we won by them shooting down the black one while we still had one out (not black)
There was a code forthat exam stuff on the board but that wasnt ours now in swdish.

We are fish today, during pe we had baseball again.
After school i couldnt make it to the bus, so i went to the thing thats like after and in the food court. I had rt3 going while i was playing pool and stuff there. Then i went home to eat, and after that i biked back, it took ~20 min. After that i realized that i could plug my computer into the tv. And then i took a controller and played tf2 (well it didnt work), cs2 (didnt work, got input but too jittery), ets2 (boring) and lastly deltarune (after trying Roblox and giving up). I played deltarune the rest of the night, occasionally going to the others and playing some number game in pool. But one time when i did i left deltarune on a fighting scene so that nothing happened. And when i came back and unplugged my laptop to sit in the couch, the image had gotten burnt in... I hope it wasnt permanent but idk. Anyways my dad came and picked me up a bit after that and then we went and picked my brother and his friend from ice hockey. They smelt like ass. I fell asleep on the way home. We took my bike on the back yk. I really wanna go back to that thing after school next time, its real fun, and if i bring my money i can buy lunch and use their microwave.

Im tired like shit now, i wont shower today, i will try to remember for tmrw.

Btw i forgot to mention, the guys from 7th grade were also there and they were annoying af, i also told one of them that im gay and a femboy, nobody seems to understand that im not joking ðŸ™ƒ
