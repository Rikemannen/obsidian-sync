I was charging the car to get radio stations. I was also doing a puzzle maze with moving stuff and buttons.

I just came to school, nothing weird. And now i see that there are posters put up for some girls night, i cant see what it says from here but it is something like that. And Yeah just guess why im writing this.

Oh and btw i didnt mention that i configured Nova launcher yesterday, it looks pretty good id say.
Oh my fucking god, i left pe early since they were anooying there and sat alone in the food court. And niva and jenny came to sit with me. And well it ended up in such a way where thy asked me if iawas trans, and well i answered honsetly and now they wont stop talking about bgetting me dresses and makeup omg i love this so much, this week couldnt have gotten better. Niva also oked about me being a furry to Agnes, oh lord.
Oh and right before rgerman started i pointed at the posters i saw this morning and told niva to ook, she understood and like piinted at me happily or wahtever yk.. :D
Oh and Arvid knocked on the door/wall idk ti the other class, and hans caught him! he got really mad and arvid got schoked and stopped.
Oh and they also want to go to the shopping centre with me and shop stuff, i did mkinda mention that right? Anyways crazy coincidence with this and morning lol.
Omg i checked my mail and they say that i can come to the volleyball today at 17:00, holy shit this is so fun.

Yay ive now played that for 1 hour. It was fun, i talked with the guy who i emailed first, he just told my to play with the team and to talk with them. At the start i sat on the floor, major mistake cuz you shouldnt basically, well i did notice myself but anyways. We played dip ball or whatever and then did some passes. I didnt really know what to do half the time but i managed. After that we served, the trainer said i was good. And lastly a match, i missed one serve from the other team, i served some times and it went well, i also saved and shot some, i was good basically. Ill basically come next time aswell.
