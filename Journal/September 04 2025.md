I have no idea what i dreamt about...

Yay late nigh-
You know the deal.

Ill start off by saying, im a bit worried that i might stop journaling, yesterday i barely wrote anything compared to [[September 02 2025]], and today i didnt write my dreams down which made me forget them. But ill still try my best and maybe even start doing it in school and other places. Well i really should anyways since ill get more written down.

Today i also got arch working on the laptop! And i decided to just go with kde, hyprland is just too much tbh. The shared home stuff were really nice having, since i dont have to copy any files. I was thinking of getting a wallpaper from my collection but thought that it is too much work to mount the drive and navigate it. 5 minutes later i realised that it was already mounted at ~/Pictures (I ended up not using a wallpaper from there) I also did some customization with like buttons, cursor and most importantly, icons, they look really good.

In school we:
- Wrote about a "boston tea party-inspired movement" in history, and we also did a test where we had to explain what happened during the french revolution, it went pretty well id say.
- Idk
I also managed to forget my clothes for p.e, i did pack them, just didnt bring them :( But i could still partake in the orientation. I got in a group with Niva and Veronika! We didnt talk much but oh my we ran, we came first, even tho i didnt have the correct clothes. But the round was fairly easy anyways. After that wee played volleyball. I suck. Me and Veronika got to go earlier cuz of buses :)
On the bus tho, there were only middle graders, i was alone :( And the ones in the back had a speaker and were playing sounds of people saying slurs, like wtf? Cant you play games instead. I went back and told them to ~~shut the fuck up~~ turn it down, but they didnt give a fuck.

In math class today, some people got to play hill climb racing or whatever on the teachers ipad. That was pretty fun watching.

Other stuff:
I havent done anything in [[Fursona making!!]] nor [[Fursuit making!!!]] since i think [[August 26 2025]]. I mean i literally said there that it didnt have to go fast, but i kinda do have a deadline til christmas, as i want to start making the fursuit before/during next year to eventually get help from people/the teacher there or learn more, idk.

During dinner today someone said something (i think mom?) about gf's and bf's (idk man üò≠) and my brother was like (once again i kinda forgot, not the best memory over here)  "he's got a bf" (talking to me ofc) and my mom was like "what do you even respond to that?", i said "well i dont have one yet", and *i mean* i wasnt lying, im now starting to wonder if he knows what i am. (my brother that is...)

Back to school ig, before history began today i got called out by our co-mentor (?) about thing i did yesterday. Basically, i was sitting with the guys i usually do, and we where doing usual stuff like taking 3 glasses each (not me) and a "tray" to carry everything on. And the teachers did **not** like that lol. So today she told me that she knew and she was suprised i was involved? And my anxiety ass could not sit still or whatever during the interrogation. She straight up told me not to cry üò≠, i look so fucked when "talking" (getting yelled at, well it wasnt really but you get it) or about relationships (understandable cuz im kinda unsure about myself rn), i keep moving my head in weird ways and not being able to sit still, all that makes it look like im both really nervous and about to cry... Anyways her talking points about this being bad were:
- It costs extra money
- It gives the people working there more work to do
I dont agree (ofc):
- What? Extra money to what? Wash the dishes (Remember, this is what she told *me* was bad about what *i* did, i.e. not taking 27 glasses for myself)
- She thought we just gave them a tray with our dishes-from-3-people? **Obviously not**, thatd be so messed up omg.

Food was broccoli and cauliflower soup, with the round sandwiches!! They are so good.

I also taught, first Veronika and eventually Niva too, how to count in binary on your hands! They ended up coming up to our table and asking if they understood how to do it correctly (And asking me to take a sandwich for them since Niva was too scared to do it herself??)

Holy cow look at ==this, i just== figured that out!!

I also still have problems with people not being able to access my site, it is now confirmed to work on:
- A personal laptop on a non school network
- A personal laptop on the school network
- A phone on a non school network
- A phone on the school network
But not on:
- A school laptop on the school network
One more thing yet to test, school laptop, non school network. But i might just switch back to ngrok and use it for as long as possible until i have to pay, and see what people think.

I just realized i have to get 10 states with their main cities in germany remembered for tomorrow, thats gonna suck. Ima set a reminder...

Mom also took me to find places to "work" at with school yk, we went to that cardboard company and the electronics store with the drivers licenses. The cardboard thing smelt like cardboard dude, holy shit it smelled like cardboard. Anyways since i barely talked, saying just "here", "hi" and "bye" i managed to stay calm. But i still dont know where to look when people talk, it feels so weird looking at them üòµ‚Äçüí´

Anyways this was a **real** journal entry, more than 1000 words. I now have to sleep :)
