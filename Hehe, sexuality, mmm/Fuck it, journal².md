I felt mixed stuff today, i want to be a femboy, but at the same time i literally created [[Trans names (if thats what i want)]]. One thing is for certain i *preferably* want a boyfriend. I also feel a little genderfluid or nb. Idk...

I also wanna add, when coming out i can say this:
- I like wearing feminine clothes
- I am attracted to boys (main thing tbh) ^be27ca
- I dont quite know what i identify as, but i dont mind people calling me a guy, i can also say that i feel a little different each day (genderfluid), but not enough for people to change their behavior around me. NO, you know what it should be short:
- i am unsure what to be referred as, but dont mind it as it is.
- I would love of people just know this about me, without feeling the need to change their behaviour around me.
- BONUS: tell them about my journal and/or being a furry if i want to.

Yea i have no idea yay!
Most things i listed here ([[#^d5e99b]]) still stand (how tf do i make the link say here???) Although i do want to change point two ([[#^be27ca]]) to add "mainly", cuz its not really fully that, but mostly. And i do not know at all what i want to identify as, but im leaning towards masulinity today (i think omg).

I was just laying here thinking about transitioning, and i got a very odd feeling about actually going through with the process of it, and i cant say i hated it.  God i really want girl clothes so i can try that shit out. My body is fucking perfect for that shit.

Ya girls done it again, i am now researching about hrt stuff again, and im just so like sad or whatever cuz i feel like my voice will be fucked forever. (The dysphoria is actually coming for me omg) And i just dont know if im really a girl or just a femboy, but to be absolutely fucking honest, i feel like the things femboys do are maybe not really enough for me... And ive literally made [[Trans names (if thats what i want)]] and keep thinking and writing girl stuff, not feminine, but maybe im just dumb. God fucking dam it i hate this so much. I just hope to god and Jesus and all that is, that i am a little late in puberty. If god wanted me to transition, then thats what it is. Im so weird rn but omg. And i literally cant talk to anyone since i know no one who is queer whatsoever, and i do kinda have a little thing that makes me hate talking to random people. Should i just fucking do it, tell my friends and see what they say. I do *really* need to talk to someone, and.. im crying rn... I think ill do *it* if i dont turn out like i want. Do with that info as you will...
Ill start figuring shit out, talking with higher pitch to myself etc. But this actually keeps me up at night (22:00 rn hehe)
Motherfucker i even try to laugh femininely, is that femboy behaviour??
Ive thought about this one thing a little, my cousins have one old sister and one young bother, both families have that, and then we come to mine, two brothers, lets fix that :3c
