I remember seeing a board with words, first like two letters and then a full word, i remember valet parking being up there...
I also feel asleep without putting my phone on the charger, so its almost dead now.
We had crafts just now, i am now sitting in the couch next to Melvin and waiting for physics to start. 
During Crafts the guys were being anoying as usual, i wont bother typing th details but they basicallyy threw trash and stuff, we also had a substitute today.

Uhh im alone rn so i can type whatever i want while looking yk
Nvm thats too risky, uhh we had pe, during that we played baseball :D
Not really the real version yk but it was a very close on with bases and whatnot. I t was really fun and we ended up winning big with abunch of home runs. But valter in the other 
I had to stop since niva started teling me nonsense stories, she is still going.She is now telling the same stuff for Wike lol
Uhh anyways baseball was fun but after that in the changing wroom oscar couldnt stop blaming others for not playing good. Oh and before we quit Sofia said the teacher miscounted the other I CANT FOCUS WITH HER TALKING OML uhh anyways Sofia said they were miscounting, but that didnt matter in the end :P
Anyways when chaning oscar said svea was horrible and didnt listen (she wasnt oml)
Idk what evlse to say there, we ate soup for lunch and bread.
I now got Inez things from freja and i took a hawirband or something and put it on my arm, actually love it oml i need this :3
Oh and another not fun thing i noticed is that you can now see my moustache :((((((((((((((((((
Now they are saying that people in Fredriks class (the teacher) think that they have too many test nex tweek, that hasnt even crossed my mind that we have 3 (everyone does, but i think one had 4 idk whatever) that just feels dumb to me but i dont mind, i just had to write this down :p
