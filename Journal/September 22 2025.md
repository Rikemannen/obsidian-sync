I dreamt about being in the us and trying to get home before school started, but i was stuck trying to order at McDonalds since there were so many things like cheese blocks and pineapple that you could buy. I eventually went to the cashier to order, but i woke up. I remember the screens were at a website called "spendrups" or smth...
I also dreamt about being at some sponsored event with shitloads of food, but that made me late or smth so i time traveled away from that to not get late..?

I have now woken up, i did take my new pants, however my mom got an "old" shirt for me. When she was looking for a shirt to have outside i said that she could take my hoodie. So yea im also gonna get my thigh highs later.

Uhh im just journaling now cuz why not, i just had music,  iplayed with Jamie most of the time , it was fun ... :)

Anyways we are waiting for physics to start wait no math to start now, and oscar just told me he was having a little thing at laserdome, and he invited me :D
And the other guys in the class are being such fukcing bitches about me, they are sitting behind me rn but they cant see :P
Anyways they keep saying that only stupid poeple can come nad that its a 

I forgot where i was, they are now asking if they should bring gifts cuz they keep saying its a party cuz he, well its a bday party basically, thats what they are saying (its not)
Nicholas is saying he can give a high five as a gift, god he is so fucking stupid, i hate that little prick bro.
Oh and nobody has said anything about me wearing a hoodie today :O
Well idk why that would be but yay
One thing that i am thinking about rn is that quote i heard/read a while back:
*Treat everyone with respect until they proove that they don't need that kind of treatment*, its so fucking good bro.
We have ust eaten, we also had math, i didnt do jack shit. Im now sitting and waiting for history to begin, tbh im kinda sad rn :(
I just want someone that can somewhat relate to me when i talk about my problems, bbut that doesnt exist :(
Uhh Ignas/Liam or whatver just broke a new ping pong racet, and they are still throwing them around :/
They also broke ignas's cap :D
An dthey are doing shit (they=valter) with melvins computer.
Uhh Algot was just like strangling melvin.... idk if it was soft or nah but what the hell??
And then i told him to stop it, and he was just like "oh hello!
And so i elbowed him in the leg (sofltly but who cares) and he pushed me and shit...
They are now having a fight... Well not him but others, god i hate em all omg.

I coded a little (idk if i mentioned) before history, and during history we watched a movie, listened to the teacher talk and then rad the book and wnswered some questions.
And im just like really sad rn, like idk if i wanna be trans or nah and its really annoying, i really want to talk to someone :( idk who tho, nobody can realate and best thing they can do is listen :(
Well lets stop with the negativity, i do know *one thing*, i like boys :3 oh and wearing femme clothes, although one thing that is really annoying are thigh highs that go down oto ypour knees after a little while.
