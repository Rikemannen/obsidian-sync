Yay i have now made a program that makes other people not see what i type!!! My friend is literally sitting next to me and cant see what im typing. Anyways we have german now!

Today during, or well between two classes i think it was, idrk rn, anyways Niva askedme if i was gay, in a joking way, and i just responded yes. I just wanted to say that :P
And since Veronika was sick i was pretty much with her for the first half of the day, during math she asked me to come like 2 times and just gave me nonsense questions. God i love hangingout with her like that, idrk how to phrase this but yea its fun that *someone* listens to me :)

One downside with this program is that i cant see if i misspell something, i think i just did but i dont know for sure, i will have to fix later. But atleast nobody can see me what im typing!! Yea this is fun lol.

We ate meatloaf today, it was pretty good. After that, during the break i played ping pong with the other girls that were there, i suck at it...


During art class we continued drawing on our folder fronts or whatever, and i feel like i forget stuff to draw on mine, for example,  i have now started drawing the bricks on it, but i forgot that i might've wanted a background, well i checked the one that was next to meand she had drawn without a background for the letters, directly on the brick that is, so ill just continue mine like it is. But of course once i found that out, we were going to pack up.

During ENglish class (it was before that but whatever) we wrote about the truman show, and since it was on that app which i cant have on my laptop, i had to type on the other laptop with a goofy ahh keyboard. Anyways i wrote ~514 words. I also added that he would have had it hard to get a ccitizenship, but then Melvin said that he would have a citizenship since he was born in the us, and so i now have to remove that...

Well we are gonna watch that german movie now, ill have to type more later, well i probably will have the chance to type during it, like i am now... but idk, we  will see :)

Oh and now when we started this class, they said that Hmpus was welcome back, he had apparently not been here for a while... I wonder where he has been. Oh and the structure of this entry will be fuuuucked lol, i can not see what i am writing AT ALL. I might add a thing where i can click a keybind to see * or something where letters should be, starting with the wrod or something similar, just to see the structure. Ill add for next class (if i dont forget)
It looks so goofy when i am writing but nothing is showing p on screen, other people must think im crazy rn.

Now when the teacher left all the guys in the class are going knocking. LITERALLY ALL OF THEM!!! Half of the guys went up and started banging the crap out of that fuck damn wall. Bro i wanna snitch so bad on them but theyll know its me. It feels so cool writing this just as they did it and they dont know (they might suspect it but who knows) :3c
Bro the guys are laughing now (not muh but the teacher is here) i justwant them to get kicked out so bad oml. Wait, they asked for tape earlier to fix books, could it have been a way to get hm out of here? Bro they are so stupid oml. 
Now when the class next to our classroom have eneded, they were knocking at the wall, and so the guys here went crazy shouting and we cant hear the other people talking, bro i hate this so muchh :(
Class is over now!!
