This is my journal within this subject, cuz y not:
# 14 sep
I felt mixed stuff today, i want to be a femboy, but at the same time i literally created [[Trans names (if thats what i want)]]. One thing is for certain i *preferably* want a boyfriend. I also feel a little genderfluid or nb. Idk...

I also wanna add, when coming out i can say this:
- I like wearing feminine clothes
- I am attracted to boys (main thing tbh)
- I dont quite know what i identify as, but i dont mind people calling me a guy, i can also say that i feel a little different each day (genderfluid), but not enough for people to change their behavior around me. NO, you know what it should be short:
- i am unsure what to be referred as, but dont mind it as it is.
- I would love of people just know this about me, without feeling the need to change their behaviour around me.
- BONUS: tell them about my journal and/or being a furry if i want to.
