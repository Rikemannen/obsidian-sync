I havent written down shit today, idk my dreams, but i know the rest somewhat:

I did nothing today!!! Well i did scroll reddit for a solid 5 hours lmao
Anyways i then showered (i didnt yesterday cuz im a dirty boi) and then we went to our "neighbors" far away to eat shrimp. We played in the yard and i slid and got grass on my pants, uhh i tried to not choose the ones i want on monday but i think i did `._.`
After that we ate, then we went upstairs and played with nerf guns. i felt so cool building the big one and putting it together yk. Then we took some string (my brother, not "we") and built a fucking net with the doors and the staircase's. We then ate ice cream with banana :D
And then i didnt wanna play anymore, i did do shit at the table like spinning the lid of a bottle really fast which was fun. And now we are here, im sitting in a couch journaling. I might go upstairs and sit there or smth idk yet. Until we meet again!

Im at home now, but before i did go home i played a little more with the others and then went to the big couch and coded some, i have now added an exercise creator to my site (still not fully released but it is there in its own branch). I then scrolled reddit again, and i told my parents i wanted to go home 4 times before we did, on the way home our neighbours kid came with us. Anyways ima scroll some reddit and then sleep :P
Time is 00:48 btw

I forgot to mention two things:
I found a really good edit of a round about, i have it an award it was so good, i think ive watched it 10 times minimum.
And im getting pancakes tmrw yay!!!

Can someone tell me why i love traffic cones so much..?

Oh and my screen time in reddit was 6 hours today (and tmrw, since time is 1:14, 47 min there)
