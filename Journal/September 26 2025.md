We just started german, and they started talking about the banging stuff right outside the two classrooms. And when we came in they started listing names that bang, and hampus said me?????? I said i have proof tho :P

We are now gonna read some, but before we did that we watched some oktoberfest stuff, and btw ignas and hampus had moved to the table in front of ours and they played those goddamn sounds from their laptops. And now that we should read, Melvin asked what page it waas on, and they said 25 when in fact it was 20, i wanna punch them so bad, they are NOT nice.
Ignas is now moving again :D Oh and erik couldnt shut up either during the video... Ignas is now playing more sounds and the teacher told him to close his laptop, he did in a haste while being "mad" fsr. Hampus now told me to close my lap
We now have tech or whatever, we swtarted by building we built bridges (idk if i wrote..) And then i got to read ijn the book again :D
And on the topic of trans stuff, yea i dont like my voice :(
NOw we are doing questions, and because the teacher left all the guys are playing sounds, well to be more exact its Ignas and Erik, Vidar and valter are playing games .
