I was at a huge pool with several underwater rooms, like one with 3d printers and one with food. Breathing was no issue sinnetou could brqtue water or smth, brother was talking. After that i went to taste test expensive food items like precppked meals and salt with som either people, it was all disgusting.
As i wrote that and was laying .y head back in my pil≈Çow i promise i heard a ragdoll universe rare chest spawning sound, just one note tho like "dutt".
Oh and to add, i also dreamt in that same dream as before that i came out to a table of people. Everything happened with my cousins or friends at school. 
I dreamt about years again, like year 2070 or smth idk.

Well we had math just now, and i did like 5 things, it was about circumference of a circle and stuff. And I also saw that Niva had a pink hoodie, holy shit it is cool, i want one so bad (like i said in [[September 17 2025]])
Anyways Veronika hadnt overslept, she was apparently sick. But that doesnt really matter now anyways...
Well we have history now, i am **not** looking forward to it :/. We are (probably) going to present our presentations we made last week, the one i didnt do anything on and the one i was with did most of the work in. We begin now, i will write more later!
I was wrong we do not begin now, in five minutes. Yea its really hard to write while not seeing anything AND with one hand (i was standing up just now) But it is pretty damn fun
Uhh idk what this document looks like rn.
Uhh oscar just asked me what i was writing, thats real funny lol, i showed him the masked output and he said "ohhh thats a lot" or something i forgot. Anyways David came with some bolt cutters or whatever now, someone has forgotten their lock's code/key :O
Idk what more to write, we start in 4 min, it is really funny to write like this, no matter what people do (except try to check my keyboard presses which is near impossible) they can not know what i am writing!! I can even do it in the classroom since nobody can prove im not just typing nothing randomly to troll. And well as long as i clear the initial output its impossible to know.
Valter just checked what i was doing, he doesnt seem to care tho.

We just got info from the pe teacher that he is going to the dentist and we are starting it later, and we are checking our results of orientating (is that correct???) from the mountain thing yk, ([[September 15 2025]]) And we are also going to have initial time to play volleyball (yay) and pingpong (among others ofc).
We just finished history now, we didnt have to present ours! only 3 people had to, one group with italy only and two other randomly chosen ones.  We now have break for like 25 min which is very nice, we have swedish next btw. Well idk what to write rn but thats a bout it ig.

Ive now added a raw command feature to my script so i can run os commands! It actually works with user interaction and stuff, and i can run for example fish in it to use fish, and then when i exit that i come back to python! Yea i just think this is so cool.

Well we had lunch now, we ate soup. Before lunch however when i was walking to my locker to put my laptop in it i got smacked in the head by Liams pingpong racket, it hurt :( well it doesnt anymore tho :)
Before we could even get into the food court or whatever i played/watched pool in the room next to it.
Ill continue later but for now ill mention that jamie wait..
I just showed him and he was suprised like crazy, he also asked if i was hacking and i subconsiously said "yea", hehe hes funny. (I *may or may not* have a *minor* crush on him hihi)
Anyways i played pool there and then (they screamed i forgot where i am) uhh well i played pool and it took ages to get in since there were poeple before and a long queue, but yea i eventually got in, sat with the guys i usually sit with and then went and now im writing this :P
We have pe after this like i mentioned but idk what to do while i wait, so im just journaling. I do wanna talk to the girls but idk where they are ;(

Yea ima go now and talk to someone or something :)

We just ended pe, and we played like volleyball and stuff the whole time, we ran one round around the football field things andthen just played other stuff. Uhh, yea thats about it ig :)

Alright i have now corrected to entry, i am now in bed home alone!! first:
i did find melvin and alwin in the couches downstairs (yk, before pe) and in the couch in front of theirs were the other girls along with Wike! Anyways we had a little wrestling match or something in the couch. And then we went outdoors and played on the chinese swing (that sounds horrible) and eventually the girls also came. Oscar came aswell with his longboard and i got to ride it, holy shit its not easy. During all this time Melvin kept saying that being gay was nothing weird and how he doesnt mind etc, and i was like "i sure hope you dont think so" and so on, he most likely didnt get it. There has been a lot of talk about that topic the past few days :3c
Anyways i got 10/10 on the solo orienting thing and 6/6 in the group ones.

Uh now for the home alone stuff, i am so mad at myself for wasting the time, i was playing ragdoll universe, and i was playing against a really good person (skill wise), #3 on monthly, with #2 and #1 being hackers, they were level 999 aswell. I killed them three times, but then i got mad at myself for some reason and left (they left before but doesnt matter). I then played that lucky block battlegrounds game, its fun. Well anyways what i then realized 5 minutes before they said they would come home (dad was picking up my brother) is that i couldve done some funnier stuff like watching a few episodes of heartstopper or getting rid of some hair on my legs or reading my new magazine that i forgot to mention i got today. Anyways i didnt wear my hoodie today since i forgot about the one i actually like and took the other one, and well i dont like it that much. But i did take my only t-shirt (again, that i like), so wearing the hoodie tmrw is not an option (in the other shirts it will look ridiculous imo). Im gonna try to get it washed until monday, and maybe even my thigh highs..?

Anyways my shoulders hurt from laying like this now, ima stop here!

Yay i forgot to mention some stuff and i am now on my phone!
Anyways i saw a reddit post asking for reaction pics, i sent the "and we are off to the comment section" image i have, its not a reaction image but its funny :)
