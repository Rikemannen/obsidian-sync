I dreamt that i had like an alternate self in a storage box which i couldnt use unless i did something, i had like fuel (not something that exists) in a brief case and i used that on something else to make it grow. The fuel can fril like the sun or smth.
idk what i meant by "fril" i was tired.

Uhh we had math just now, we did a physics test about heat, and it was 9 questions with one bonus question to write more to write more bout what you know/have learnt on top of the other stuff, i wrote about how refrigerators work. I also had to get an additional paper to write on since i had written all i could on the first one, and well i got up, took a paper, sat down on the chair on the wood thing that was in the way and ripped a hole in my pants :)
Idk what else to say really, we had german, with the words, it went well, we also did some things in our books, but since we also read, the class was over pretty quick.
We have tech or whatever now and i was the one who read the pages in the book, since everyone wants that :) Uh yea thats it i just wanna write that :P

(home)
We had english words aswell, i learnt them all in ~5 minutes :P

During swedish today tho, we were discussing the book, sofia went to someone else and so we got agnes instead, so me agnes niva and melvin were together (we sit at the table together if i didnt mention, not agnes tho)
Anyways we talked about the questions and the moved on to the notes above them, and we discussed why we added some chapters to them and some didnt etc. And there was one part of the class when we just got caught up about a *very important* subject, homosexuality :3
We talked about who in the book had done it, why one chapter wasnt in it even if they mentioned it etc. and how one of the main people in the book were homophobic (idk niva said that and everyone disagreed, she changed her mind). It was fun :D
*Of course* that wasnt all we talked about, we also talked about the other things such as drug abuse and depression but those arent as enjoyable...

At home i have now started doing some changes to my site, before that i just did nothing pretty much. I have one issue were a checkbox in exercise settings just refuses to work, it works locally but not on the actual site :/
