Bro we have english now and ignas is acting like a god damn 5 year old saying he doesnt need his computer and then smiling at the rest of the pople here when te teacher pretends to take it, this is so messed up.

we had deutsch, why did i type like that, anyways now we have physics, before german some guys destroyed a table by flipping it and stuff, yk those rounds ones, and the table part came off, the screws. And now right before physics, Nelia in like 6th or 7th grade got the chinese swing (idk what it is cALLED SRY) oop caps anyways she got it in her neck, and the ambulance is here and everyone is looking, standing by the window etc.
until later ig
