Writing this [[August 20 2025]] but whatever, i forgot to add (i think this was the date lol) that the, ill call him "homophobic guy" cuz i hate writing names fsr and it kinda fits him, i kinda made a huge thing today imo, here's the story:
We were in physics class and we had just done an experiement about putting soda cans with boiling water in cold water to watch them imploding, well the group that was on my assigned seat had spilled shitloads of water, like a liter somehow, and the girl in the group (well one of them, since it was a girlie-group (lol what) took their computer bag and started wiping the water?? what? well i ran to get paper and dried it up, and then i saw one guy sitting close to the trash can, i told him to catch the paper as i threw it (he didnt), lo and behold the teacher saw it and told me to not do that. And of *course* the homophobic guy just *had* to say:
- Hey do you want me to tell ur mentor?
My (epic) response:
- Shut the fuck up (in swedish ofc)
He said *"sorry"*?!‽?!‽?!‽?!‽?!‽ Holy what? idk why he said it if he meant it or no but i have **never** heard him say that word **EVER**.
Holy macaroni i write a lot.

I dont remember much of today (yes its night rn) but what i do remember is during English today, Ignas (:O) figured out you could connect the laptop to the room tv via bt. Wow so cool. Anyways he sent a pairing request, and the teacher, like most of them, didnt read shit on the popup and just clicked accept.
