I dreamt that i was building large constructions but was missing parts. No Lucid dreaming today btw, i forgot to change alarm volume...

So we just had like a class thing where we take up our questions and opinions and stuff. Uhh we started by saying stuff like too few computers and then we went with each person saying something, i told them about the situation in german where popele bang and whatnot. And it seemed just like thy didnt give a fuck, agnes also agreed with me but again, they dont gaf.

We made music in music class oh and ive forgot to mention that im playing in the hall of the mountain king as my song of choice! We measured round stuff to get pi (closest i got was 3.148) during math, ate "cooked" sausage with cheese and mashed potatoes during lunch and did some history thing where we checked if cecil rhodes's statues should be removed from universities. Thats all, during lunch break me and melvin and alwin went to the store to shop, i was gonna pay (this time getting money back yk) but ofc i had to input my code which i had forgotten (not my fault since it happens so rarely that i never have to memorize it) and so i got 2 wrong tries and stopped there, not risking locking it, turns out 3/4 numbers were correct... they were the same (the 3 not 4). Anyways after school ended i went and bought a cinnamon bun and cookies. I then waited with oscar a bit and then he left, for my meeting to start today! My mentor says im really good :D

Anyways after that i went home and eventually oscar came (we had planned a meetup), we baked brownies (one side normal and other side with molten chocolate and peanuts), we also had a video call with melvin and partly alwin and kasper aswell, first part of baking, from start → in oven went well with minimal mess, after that we microwaved chocolate and then put it in a bag to spritz or whatever, that failed and we ended up just spreading it out, it was a mess. Then we put them in the fridge and ate some thing with rice, chicken and sauce in the oven, it was really good. Me and oscar also played a lil mario party!

Anyways thats my day, i also scrolled mcmaster-carr (yeah im weird, howd u know?) and then played general ragdoll chaos a good while, i discovered you could upgrade stuff like amount earned while ragdolled and whatever, which was nice. I earned a lot of money.

Ima sleep now, this was a short entry.

Wait omg i forgot, we also went to the engraver and made an image of his dog on a piece of wood, it was thin af you could see through it. And tmrw the girls who want things are coming :D

Im unironically sitting with my legs crossed rn :3

Oh and fun thing during math, i asked Niva and Veronika if they could type an emoticon on the calculator, thinking they couldnt. BOTH of them types x3 after just a wee bit of thinking... And i thought i was smart x3

Btw its 22:50 rn, but everyone else was asleep at like 22:10 today... Idk why so early but ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
