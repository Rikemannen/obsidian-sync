Ã¥I remember about shopping stuff with trucks, but nothing more.

Alright, the time is 9:47, lets make this quick, i have physics in like 7 min.
Well during woodworking the teacher asked if any strong guys could help carry something, i said "ill try" and turns out we were going to carry material that was gonna get scrapped from the building of a classroom. While we were carrying and going back for more and when we were walking past the music classroom the girls were in the room closest to the "road", the girls including Millie and her friends... and when i walked by the went fucking wild knocking and everything, and she made a heart bro omg. Yea she actually likes me ([[September 02 2025]]). And so im now stressing the fuck out about what i shall say when she actually asks.
I wrote that and then couldnt do anymore since there were 2 people close to me, i am now waiting for the bus. Anyways she was also at the bus stop, and i literally acted like she wasnt there/i didnt know she likes me.

Well idrk what else to write, ill say im pretty paranoid that someones reading this behind me or smth lol.
I did bring the brownies, they were cold asf, and when i went to give the first guy one he got 3 since they were stuck together. I also gave to the girls that have their lockers around mine the rest after lunch.

During lunch i sat with Vidar and Erik, and when Erik had left, we started taking a bunch of lemons (we used like 11 total) and pressing them into a glass to drink.
