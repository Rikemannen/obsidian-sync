I dreamt about doing a physics test and then talking to people after, i did have something before this but i didnt write down...
I also biked to school that day

That wasnt much uhh, right before i went to school my mom said that she and my brother were gonna go shopping for clothes, and asked if i wanted to sometime, i said yes and now im wondering if i should tell her? That'd mean i get what i really want.
Right before we started the day in our home classsrom i played some rt3, and i stressed like crazy to get all customers out before we started at 8, and she called (teacher) us in earlier so i played in the classroom too, but i managed to get the restaurant empty 5 seconds before.

God we are doing a text of some kind rn in history and we are supposted to write if the source is good or bad, it sucks, idk what to write on the things :(
Valter also reacted with "What the hell are you writing" when i was writing this.

Yay i forgot to journal!!! Anwyays we ate lunch, it was noodles and chicken wok, i sat with niva and veronika since we had goofed around in the line in and everyone else i knew had left me ;)
We went from the food court 10 min before our class started. During art we drew (duhh) and i made some bricks on my image, i am gonna start coloring next week. And when class was ending and we were collecting all pencils again i wanted to leave so i started looking for them, and i didnt find them, turns out some other girs from 9th grade had them, and the teacher said that i could leave first since i was the only one who was looking for them :D

Right before german stared we went into the spanish classroom and goofed around (i love saying goofed lol) and then we went away again then they didnt want us there. But right before we did the teacher said he would get the principal if they knocked, and i said "YEA DO THAT!", he didnt hear tho, i dont think he did but whatever.
So im gonna try to write down the people that do knock later on :P
We had quiz stuff today in german two sides with 16 questions each and asking eachother, it was kinda fun, but the people that are annoying were really annoying and made it not fun. Anyways the other team won, they also admitted to wrongly correcting our answers but idc, everyone else *did*. But nobody banged on the wall :D, ignas was close to doing it when the other side did `._.` but the teacher stopped him... somehow?

During physics we were connecting lamps and batteries, and i thought about how cool it'd be if i brought my multimeter :)
Anyways we connected single lamp, dual in series and parallel, single lamp with two batteries in series and parallel. I knew how to do them all >:3 We also wrote wiring schematics which i knew how to do except for what lamps look like...
He also said that we are gonna build our own batteries and stuff in 9th grade... if we get him that is (idk we probably will anyways but thats my thought).

After class ended i went with Niva and Veronika to the store and bought some stuff, i bought those cinnamon bun things that are tiny, and Niva bought the same thing but cinnamon bun shaped... Veronika paid
I (for some reason) paid double. Idk why i do this, last time i was in the store and someone else payed (i payed with someone elses card, [[September 12 2025]]) Anyways i basically ended up earning Veronika 20 money (i write money cuz "kr" is cringe :P)

I am now at home and im writing this, i didnt eat anything except went right up BUT i did start a print for that guy's things. Im halfway done, or even more idk. Ima play rt3 now :P

I have now played a lot of rt3, i rebuilt my restaurant to make it even bigger, i have all the bottom floor expansions now. I also put out a bunch of tables, well not many but all i could (except for small ones). I had like 20k as my highest, then bought expansions and went down to just a few k. My biggest check from one table was >300. Idk what else to write, i am going to sleep now (soon).
