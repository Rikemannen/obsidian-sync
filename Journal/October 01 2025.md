Fuck i deleted my dream entry, i did not know what if dreamt about except for dreaming about forgetting it, well not thats not a dream, idk.

what
Did this shit not save or what????
iLL oops ill just write this again, we had history and we were talking about the swedish revolution, when the teacher talked about who was missing in a list of important people/companies the fire alarm went and we had to go, the teacher was like "NOO!", i also wrote my notes in markdown fsr and it looked much better (remember on paer)
I kinda forgot to journal, during the break before english, me melvin alwin niva and veronika went to the art class to draw a little, it was open (i didnt draw anything :P)
We ate fish for lunch, but during english we did some exercise thing, thats it ig
Uhh anyways we ate fish and then well we are now waiting for art to start for real, im sitting in a couch and valter is sitting on the one next to me (with his friends) and they are annyoing m, i really wanna just drive my screwdriver into his leg when he annoys me again :3
Fucking hell they are knocking

I dragged ignas's finger and twisted it and it cracked, and i the scratched him with my screwdriver the next tim he did it.
Algot is now also being annying and ignas is touching me and valter is kicking me and they are both banging on the couch wall
algot is so fucking annoying oml
We have art now and i am not happy o be sitting near the troublemakeers, i really wannaj just hurt them, im sorry but they fucking suckk oomg

I was unhappy there for a reason. Towards the end of the class ignas started talking about how he doesnt do anything annoying. That annoyed me so much i literally showed him the journal entries where i write about him and read them aloud. He just played it off or something I DONT EVEN KNOW and it didnt bother him whatsoever. He then told Vidar a bit after who said he never banged on that wall during German, which i dont have the details for but i HIGHLY doubt, hes just tryna save his ass. And idc if he has or hasnt, hes still a bitch.
Anyways i also read one part where ignas had walked up to me and went annoying, i said he called me an idiot which tbf he didnt, and he knew, so wth man. I just want them to stop but how???
Im gonna try starting to write as many details as i can about them just to make them fucking stop. From now on this journal is not gonna be entertaining. Or maybe ill just use another file, we will see. Why cant the teachers to something?

My brother has now being a shitloads of berries onto the bus, and hes gonna being then home or something, i know hes gonna do some weird shit, but even if he doesnt i just dont like him having them. Well what the fuck, why should i care.

Uhh the bus driver took a wrong turn and now we are even more late, i should be home rn, 14.26. biking would be faster.

Im at home, ive been for a while, we have now planned Laserdome for Saturday 17-18:00 and we eat McDonalds there, most of us atleast. Anyways i then played cs with Ludvig and wanted to play mcpe with Melvin but i had to go and so we never did. We ate spaghetti for dinner and watched a movie. During the movie the guys in the group talked and some other guy joined. This next part is gonna be weird af but the way he wrote was pretty awesome, like he used emoticons and stuff like i do and i like it. And so, naturally when i asked Adam who invited him who it was and he said a random gay, i reacted *a bit*...

I also told my mom about the guys in school, but she didnt really help tbh. Im just becoming like sad rn, i really want to talk to someone who cares, like the school curator or whatever its called. Or just my mentor but idrk how anything will go. I hate this. I just gotta get through tmrw and then fun shit happens. Tmrw we play baseball anyways so its not too bad. Ill also wear my thigh highs to the thing on Friday, its decided as of now. I kinda want someone to find out... I wanna come out, i want to be trans, i want to be a guy, i want to get a bf, i hate this, yet i love it. [[Fuck it, journalÂ²]] is officially no more, well it is but not as much.

Enough for today, gn
