I have no idea what i dreamt about, i think it was about doing something quickly but i do not know what. But i actually feel asleep faster today, maybe due to the cat being in the room?

Well alright, i feel like nothing fun happened today, we had spaghetti and meat sauce for lunch but thats about it.

Well on English today i read the person next to me's text and it was really good except for some spelling stuff. And she said mine was good too :D. The teacher also said it was awesome, and didnt mention any issues either :P

I also got some info about the mc server, it seems to be getting ready to be "launched" tomorrow. I also did some talking but i feel like they wonder "who tf is that??". And i also asked some dumb questions, but i got to talk to people :)

Well this is enough for today? Still cant remember what the hell i dreamt about, but Oh well.
