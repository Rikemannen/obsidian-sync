I dreamt i was in school and for some reason everyone has pillows, they came in two sizes and were needed in order to open doors. Otherwise everything else was seemingly normal.

God its actually late rn so i wont write much, im trying to get my laptop working since i formatted the efi partition when trying to install arch, i did mean to do it, and i now have to fix it so i can boot manjato tomorrow for school, since the arch hyprland rice (yes i wanted to have a hyprland rice again after a long time) i got is good, but not awesome so i want to switch, and my dumbass didnt make a btrfs snapshot or anything of the drive/partition before i installed it, so ill probably have two reinstall arch again. And endeavour os just doesn twabt to mount the efi partition, and i cant be arsed to get my usb stick to get a live iso so ill just fix manjaro.

Nothing much happened today anyways, we watched a movie in English class, i forgot the name, will write tmrw. My physics teacher said that he was just yesterday and couldnt do the thing, thank god.

Going to fix this damned laptop, and then sleep, now.
