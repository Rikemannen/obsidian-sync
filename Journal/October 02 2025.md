Idk, i remember something about trading stuff for like a chair. And being in school and there being stuff like pool with gold ball instead and a laser cutter in one room and well nothing else, but there was stuff.Ill just journal rq, uh we had history again, we wrote some stuff down and talked about it, we also read during that 20 min so it wasnt that long nor that bad. We then had oh wait no we had a test in math, it was pretty easy but i got stuck on the easiest question fsr, we then had swedish test just now and i sat 30 minutes not doing anything, well almost, since i was done pretty quick , it wasnt too bad, when erik wanted to go to the toilet in the middle of it, the teacher asked if he had given his phone this morning to the thing yk, and he said no and that he had it at home, the teacher said that he has to do that in order to go to the toilet next time cuz he might cheat?? he did get to go tho. Anyways we are eating spaghetti today for lunch, same as yesterdays dinner. And thats about it, i just wanted to journal now before going since after ima have pe and not have time to.
