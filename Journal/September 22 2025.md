I dreamt about being in the us and trying to get home before school started, but i was stuck trying to order at McDonalds since there were so many things like cheese blocks and pineapple that you could buy. I eventually went to the cashier to order, but i woke up. I remember the screens were at a website called "spendrups" or smth...
I also dreamt about being at some sponsored event with shitloads of food, but that made me late or smth so i time traveled away from that to not get late..?

I have now woken up, i did take my new pants, however my mom got an "old" shirt for me. When she was looking for a shirt to have outside i said that she could take my hoodie. So yea im also gonna get my thigh highs later.

Uhh im just journaling now cuz why not, i just had music, i played with Jamie most of the time, it was fun... :)

Anyways we are waiting for math to start now, and oscar just told me he was having a little thing at laserdome, and he invited me :D
And the other guys in the class are being such fucking bitches about it, they are sitting behind me rn but they cant see that im talking smack about them :P
Anyways they keep saying that only stupid people can come and that its a birtday party even though its not, they do it to be mean and funny, but how the actual hell is that funny?

I forgot where i was, they are now asking if they should bring gifts cuz they keep saying its a party.
Nicholas is saying he can give a high five as a gift, god he is so fucking annoying, i hate that little prick bro.
Oh and nobody has said anything about me wearing a hoodie today :O
Well idk why that would be but yay
One thing that i am thinking about rn is that quote i read a while back:
*Treat everyone with respect until they prove that they don't need that kind of treatment*, its so fucking good bro and applies to most guys in my class (except for my friends :D)
We have just eaten meatballs, they tasted like ass :(, we also had math, i didnt do jack shit. Im now sitting and waiting for history to begin, tbh im kinda sad rn :(
I just want someone that can somewhat relate to me when i talk about my problems, but that doesnt exist in my vincinity :(
Uhh Ignas/Liam or whatver just broke a new ping pong racket, and they are still throwing them around :/ They also broke ignas's cap :D
And they are doing shit (they=valter) with melvins computer.
Uhh Algot was just like strangling melvin.... idk if it was soft or nah but what the hell??
And then i told him to stop it, and he was just like "oh hello!
And so i elbowed him in the leg (sofltly but who cares) and he pushed me and shit...
They are now having a fight... Well not him but others, god i hate em all omg.
One thing i keep wondering is if i am strong enough to knock someone out? Like i definetly want to sometimes, but *can* i? Of course the following stuff will be horrible, or maybe not? Who the hell knows. If its anything about my identity (or someone else's who knows :3c) then we will be finding out!

I coded a little (idk if i mentioned) before history, and during history we watched a movie, listened to the teacher talk and then rad the book and wnswered some questions.
And im just like really sad rn, like idk if i wanna be trans or nah and its really annoying, i really want to talk to someone :( idk who tho, nobody can realate and best thing they can do is listen :(
Well lets stop with the negativity, i do know *one thing*, i like boys :3 oh and wearing femme clothes, although one thing that is really annoying are thigh highs that go down to your knees after a little while. (mine)
well Niva has just sat down on my table, aswell as veronika (and alwin is also here.) i just wanna tell them all but idk how they will react and if theyll help etc raaahh.

Im home and have been for a while now, i coded a bit and then scrolled reddit (not that much i got tired) and then my mom came home and wanted me to go downstairs. OH and i still havent mentioned (to my knowledge) that i got info that 3 (?) girls from some school thats one tier above ours (idk what it is called...) want me to help them engrave wood for coasters, and so we are moving the machine into dad's workshop. I do have one issue: lightburn wont work on linux anymore, so i need lasergrbl, but there is a pc outdoors that should work :) they were supposted to call me but haven't yet.

Oh and i also forgot my charger today to school, but i managed to get through with like 40% left (while battery is also capped at 75%!) this laptop is really good lol. Ive also thought about maybe leaving my charger at home in the future and bring my powerbank so i can get energy if i need to but ill most likely last every day unless i game.

Well i forgot to mention, now that i am at home alone with my mom, the urges to come out are insane. I mean she will be supportive (most likely, i dont see why not). Im getting a different feeling in my chest just thinking about going into the kitchen and saying it, cuz when i say the first few words i cant go back, and i know ill like it but hmm. God i might just do it. oifbwiö öwghoigsn4eh08 i really want to omg this is impossible wth. ill go help in the kitchen and see if i just do...
Ok so i didnt, but my new thing is gonna be that ill help my mom with stuff without having to and if i feel like its the right time to, ill come out.

Uhh i was just scrolling reddit now (once again) and i got a lil bored and started touching my face. And i smelt something odd between my thumb and index finger when putting them together, it smells like public restroom, you can not make this shit up oml.
And i also thought about something else now, which further proves that i am indeed trans, i just thought about how going to restrooms in that mall would be, since there aren't any unisex toilets, if i pass visually, then i can actually go to the female one, which brings me yoy/euphoria or whatever, so yeah, im trans, now how do i tell my mom (mainly) that i want to do this etc.

I have thought about something. When i first started feeling like a femboy, i got that feeling kicked away within 1 business day. And then when we had our vacation to Portugal, i felt it again, a bit stronger, changing my monkeytype theme to pink and holding my fingers as if im shy when walking in the city (this were the "main" days and last days respectively). I also checked to see if there were femboy subreddits (there were duhh, but i just say r/femboy but whatever, i never clicked) And then once we came home/a bit later that got thrown out again and i didnt think of it. And then the winter that year i felt the same thing again, idk the details but i did. I even checked some subreddit i think? AND once again it got "ignored". But then, may 29th, as we were nearing summer break (last weekend before) we had one or two extra days of free time or whatever (pretty sure it was one), i scrolled reddit like i had done daily for a while, and i saw a comment of some guy saying something (must've been the teenagers subreddit otherwise idk), i clicked his profile and saw the boykisser subreddit and i *knew* what a boykisser was (well duh its in the name but you get it). And that same day i doomscrolled r/boykisser3. I had been converted. After that i made my keychain and drew on my phone yadda yadda. But i am thinking. I have had thoughts about being trans two times, one that i dont know, other one was when i researched it like crazy and wanted puberty blockers etc but never did. AND, now. Is this a repeat of last time except with fewer steps (4 → 3)? Same thing can actually be applied to lucid dreaming, i tried once by just waking up in the middle of the night, my parents wondered why i did and i never did become lucid, another time doing things a bit differently by writing down a journal (first time i ever journaled!) and then giving up, tho i did detail a lot of things, i even remember some bits of one dream i wrote down! And then once again, this time having it as a confirmation to journal in order to disable my alarm in the morning, that was my worst fail ever, i started just writing ".". AND we are nearing #4 / we are now in #4, where i journal my dreams pretty much every day, i think i have missed 2 times so far. And its pretty detailed. Discovering i was gay is just a bonus on top of the femboy one, and ftr im not gay, im bi, well ok i am leaning more and more towards boys but yeah. Oh and ill also say that ive started blushing a bit more (or atleast feeling like it) in different situations. It mostly happens when something that strikes me significantly happens. So when someone talks about liking any gender (for example, best example) i get feelings like that and maybe start blushing too since i am trying to figure that kind of stuff out rn in different ways than everyone else.

I cant stop smelling my fingers and now i have remembered i have my earbuds in my ears with no sound and that i need friends and that i am now gonna scroll more and that i have soon surpassed [[September 17 2025]] in word count. I will do some lnj to get more >:3 (30 words or smth :O)

Ive just scrolled through all my (most atleast) stuff pics, i have a lot. And i cant help but feel like a guy being gay and not a girl being straight (if you get it). So big news: im... wait. Am i genderfluid or nb? I think my ideal thing would be trans nb? I hate this so much rahh idk.

I have now played some sound space and i actually beat tilt with s++++ and ghost!! and it wasnt half bad either, first attempt i got like 25 misses, i then turned on hit effects and tried again, this time getting 9 misses, placing me on the leaderboard for the first time ever!! 6 th place btw, i then tried again and got 2 MISSES!! I am now #3 on the leaderboard :3

I am now "playing" rt3, but my headphones decided to shit themselves and started sounding scary af. Ultraw has now added drinks to rt3 btw!
I also changed battery on my mouse, which was the reason it was ass :/

Uhh i played more rt3 and started building on my extension to it, my mom and dad wanted me to go shower so bad, which makes me want to do it less. I did eventually tho ofc. And now i am here, i also got my first food critic! They gave me 2.3 stars (or 3.2 i forgot)
Anyways i really am trans, no matter how much i deny it, best i can do is nb. Im jk but i am certainly not sure. Anyways this was my first 2000 word entry. A lot of venting here and in [[Hehe, sexuality, mmm/Fuck it, journal²|Fuck it, journal²]] but i like it :)

Im not gonna sleep for a lil now, goodnight.
