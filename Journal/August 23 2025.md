I dont remember the first dream since i didnt write it down in immediately. Second dream was that i was with my cousins and we were going to some activity. But then another person asked if i wanted to switch places with them on a u-boat. I did, and the other person who was supposed to follow just disappeared. I also think i had one dream where i was painting something.

Oh and for breakfast i got pancakes :3

We went to a market today, it was could out so i took pants on, AND THIGH HIGHS >:3 and it was nice af, i didnt freeze at all (both because i wore that and because it wasnt *that* cold) on my legs, but a little on my upper body.

After the market we went to shop for groceries.

I've now also realised that, ([[August 16 2025]]) yes, in fact, i am a furry. 100% lol. I've watched some fursuit-making videos, and it doesnt seem that hard, i've also started thinking about my fursona.
