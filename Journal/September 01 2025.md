Once again im lazy af and didnt write anything down :(

Yay ive gotten obsidian working on the pc!!!

You know what time it is‚ÄΩ ITS LATE NIGHT JOURNALLING TIME!!!

Today i wore my thigh highs to school again, its kinda like no big deal anymore lol. Other fun stuff:
- I literally dont know
- God i wish i could write i got a bf, or even just a friend at this point üò≠
Oh no hold on, i asked my physics math whatever teacher about the 3d printer since it was mentioned, and we arranged to fix it tomorrow!!
He said the issue is that it doesnt wanna move and whatnot, and it is also dirty as fuck, dust **everywhere**. God i hope it isnt broken, thatd suck ass.

Other stuff i did:
Before going to the bus home, i got apples to eat, they were mid at best. Oh and my brothers friend asked if i wanted to buy some chocolate chip thing ü•∫ I kinda forgot afterwards but yea i want that, but i also wanna bake myself. Im gonna ask where he got the chocolate chips tho, since i only found dark chocolate üò• I might bake tmrw if i have time, but i also wanna go to the thing in the lunch hall or whatever where you get toast and (hopefully) a bf, god im so desperate. Someone mentioned like 4 days ago that like everyone who went there was, well take a wild guess.
And today, the guy i hang out with sometimes (god i really hate mentioning people fsr) *asked*, atleast i think this is what he asked, where we had next lesson at, i said in the G house (bro that sound so weird üò≠) and he was like "in the gay house?" and i was like "yea", he also added that it was, and here i mention names, Vidar and Erik's favorite place, since they "kissed" not so long ago??? Bro if its anyones favorite place its mine >:3 Of course he doesnt know, barely anyone does. Who does really?
- Nils - literally told him in the food court when he asked "who's gay?" When someone joked. And i also did but i sounded so serious he was just like "cool", yea...
- Niva, Veronika - They literally call me a femboy üò≠, although idk if they think im just weird and into anime/kawaii as they say, or they actually think (know) *the truth*.
- My brother - i *kinda* told him, and ove shown bk images to him, but he just thinks im weird.
- literally everyone else - no/somewhat of a clue
It wouldnt surprise me if someone knows **exactly** what my keychain is, but i still doubt it.
Ive also forgot to mention a couple of days now, that i think since Thursday, on the art lesson, someone named Daphne came to the school, and half the class went crazy, i mean ive heard about her before, but what? And they kept asking where "Scarlet" was, turns out (atleast i remember it as then saying) it was her gf!! So cool, literally the first person of that kind (bruh my descriptions...) that ive ever met (that kind of way atleast, i mean ive seen others) but its so cool! I never meet foreign people, and for them to be that? Anyways idk why thats such a big deal to me. Well i did learn something, that the other guys do bully people (to some extent) that are like me... Yay :|
Anyways ich will schlafen or whatever now.üêß
