Idk what i dreamt about, mightve been something about building buw idk.

Yay bus journalling ftw
I hate when i gotta start journalling, but whatever, during pe we ran/jogged/walked a bit and then did whatever we wanted, i played volleyball as always, and i did pretty good (imo).

During math i got bored and started writing py on the calculator, i then showed the teacher, and he took a bit of it up on the board, i then started, along with others, memorising them, i got the whole upper row and 2 more, that means i know 27 (?) digits!
