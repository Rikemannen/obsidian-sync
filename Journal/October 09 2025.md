I dreamt about playing/watching the world Championship or Olympics which was set at our school. There was a table with a projector showing most peoples locations.
I also got kicked or whatever for the first round since i blocked the way for someone once. Idk much more.
I also dreamt about some uranium alarm being activated and taking a small uranium sample and throwing in a containment thing. There was then some green gas in the room which turned out to be fake, so it was a drill, but wtf did i throw?

Alright we have now swum, anyways first 8 lengths were really hard since it has stomache swim or whatever and i suck at it. It was 200 meters total, then 2 back swims which was really easy, idk why im so good at the latter.
While we were chanigng to our normal clothes, wait
i showed sofias the writing and she was suprised lol. Anyways while we were changing again after swimming i ripped my underwear. Oh well most of mine are anyways, and well i decided not to bring the fresh ones to that so thats one thing. Melvin also lost his swimming shorts or whatever theyre called :(

Im now waiting for my mom to pick me up for volleyball. Im wondering if i should get pancakes or nah. I did eat a bit cuz it was like kale and meat which is pretty good. Whatever uhh during pe we played harry potter, yeah it was real fun, first round we won, then the second one i was real hyped fsr (i dont mind lol) and i saved our cones a lot really easily, but i went out ofc, alwin was last but he also got hit. Oh well it was fun :) but... basketball (we had after) was not, they kept getting fouls and blaming eachother. I just do not like it....
Oh and when changing i remembered that i forgot my towel, i used melvins cuz he used mine a while ago. Anyways uhh the guys also said that they are not looking forward to volleyball tournament :(
If im being totally honest here, im pretty sure i'll have transitioned before that even is, so i dont gotta worry about that.

Idk what else to write, we had swedish and worked a bit more on those texts and other questions in the book, the teacher read one text (not from us) that was on an E level yk, and it was like 250 words... Mine is 50. I suck at swedish, but i dont hate it??
We had math, we switched places again since his app could like have two classrooms so y not? I got placed in front of jenny and niva :D
Math was fun aswell, it wasnt *that* loud in the classroom.

Oh my god i didnt mention, during lunch i sat with niva and jenny, it was fun, anyways they said something about me being gay and so i got to correct them :D, niva immediately picked it up yk, but jenny was in denial fsr. Idk if jenny knows im really serious? Niva also said i look like id be bi?? Oh well.

Alright im home from volleyball now, mom came a bit late and i kinda forgot to go outside so we just barely made it, Niva came a bit late due to the bus (it was planned). We started by doing some sack ball thing where we made 3 teams and there were winners, servers or smth and out. Servers served to Winners, and if Servers won they moved to Winners, Winners out and out → Servers, if winners win, Servers ←→ Out and Winners get a point. My team did pretty good. Then we did some game where you started with one of the three, lets say kicker, so as kicker you threw a ball to a server and they passed back and you kicked it over (hand over net yk) and then someone tries to block on the other side, blocker. And then you switch place:
Kicker → Server → Blocker → Kicker...
And we switched from 5th to 1st mid game (left to right/right to left idk)
We then did serving, overhand or whatever, i got help from someone else and the second coach, i now *understand* how to do it, but im not perfectly good at it.
We then did a match, i did some good shots/passes.
And on the way home my mom asked me if there were any cute girls there `._.` I just said that i dont really think about it, and tbh i wouldnt say so. I mean i kinda prefer guys but i am bi so i need to say my opinion yadda yadda.

Thats my day so far, ima read about voice training now. I cant stop thinking about just telling my friends "listen to this" and just talk in a voice so feminine theyll fall in love with me (not really but yk really good is what i mean).
