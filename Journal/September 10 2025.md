I dont remember my dreams :<
I woke up tired asf aswell, i didnt put my phone away after falling asleep (well before but whatever), luckily it was off and not even in my journal.

I have no idea how im gonna return the book, ill probably ask if Melvin wants to go return it before lunch or something.

I also fixed and issue i had with the phone and GitHub being stupid, not allowing me to push not pull. I just reinstalled obsidian...

I was walking to the first class, history, and i eyed down the goth, emo whatever girl in 9th class and she saw me, i didnt mean to, i was looking at the stair and she walked by so my eyes locked on her omg i feel so bad rn.
