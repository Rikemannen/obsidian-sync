I dreamt about counting pi at home and in class, surprised? I also helped some other person people remove grass on a field??

I forgot to push dream stuff, oh well.
I have swedish class in like 5 min, im sitting in the classroom rn, it is calm af in here lol.
Ive had german, we had hw but i knew most of them, and besides it was on the board today. But the teacher said something that made me react. That the words arent graded based on if we know them or not, except they are graded in the way where he checks our tests later and sees if we include them or not. I *might* have to get better at doing my hw...
We then had math :D
I wrote down 108 digits of pi, i got the last two wrong, but that's since i didnt really know them, i just guessed. When the class ended i managed to forget my laptop since i wrote on the board the last thing i did and thought i had all my items. Well i ran back and took it, it was embarrasing af.
And now we have swedish, im trying to learn 150 digits of pi rn.

After coming home i did some stuff with my site, and then i played some soundspace, ragdoll universe and probably others. I managed to get a new pb streak in ru, i got like 60 or smth, it was in greenscreen with no modifier (i think). I then learned more pi, i can now do 100 in any condition, 200 with song and keypad, but no more at all.

Before the bus home today (no bus journalling ðŸ˜­) Ellen told me to run to the shop and get one candy bar and one drink, i got her card and a bunch of other people wanted stuff, me and my brother ran there, got one go-well strawberry, one japp (that is NOT english lmao), one coke, one fanta and some digestives. it didnt cost much at all. When we came back she was not happy we had done that. I gave her some stuff, and the other to the others. When i then got on the bus i paid her the full amount because i am so nice. She got happy.

We have that guy over again today, i hid in the stairs and scared him once, he then got me back after a while. We ate spaghetti n' meatsauce for dinner, and lasagna for lunch, altough i also ate plant nuggets or whatever. The lasagna wasnt half bad.

I also saw some drawing of two protogens kissing, its so cute omg. Anyways schools out at five (ivycomb song where someone said that part sounds like last friday night and its friday night rn yadda yadda) and im tired as shiet. I do have one more thing to metion:
Before english class started there were a couple of guys in 9th grade who sat at the same table as me waiting, and they started asking what i could do on my pc and stuff. And then i told them i could a shitload of digits in pi, and they wanted me to show them, and there i sat saying 100 digits of pi, they were amazed. And they did NOT believe that i learnt it in one day. I am a quick learner *if i want to*.

I also wanna say that during english class we had hw, it was *"orally ðŸ¤¨*" (wtf why is the emoji italic *ðŸ¦‚*, best emoji ever), i always think the exact same thing when she says that, it was really easy. We then did some talking to eachother. And the other guys just had to be annoying as fuck. The guy behind me brought a flipping flip phone he found at home. It waas actually pretty funny and i did laugh once, but the teacher caught me (ofc, its a serious crime) and i felt pretty bad (i always do). But that doesnt, by any means, revoke my right to say that its annoying.

Ill also add here that i am now thinking a lot about guys, i am getting gayer every day.

I wanna sleep now. (That sounds so cryptic)
