I dreamt about cooking food with 2 others. There was a **lot** of fish stuff. We had fish nuggets, salmon etc all precooked on multiple plates. I served like 3 people before waking up.

Oh and i got pancakes for breakfast!

We are now on the way to shop. Ive looked out the window a solid 10 minutes and it is starting to get boring. Idk what to write here but ill say some things that ive thought about.
I like how firstly i started just vaguely writing my dreams down here, and now we suddenly have a full on journal.

In my days of journaling i made some promises about future entries that never happened:
[[October 01 2025]] no, that is not true, [[Fuck it, journalÂ²]] is more, just look at [[Fuck it, journalÂ²#8 oct]]...

Ill add more later maybe, anyways we are on our way home, i have now gotten pants and a shirt to have outside my training clothes, shoes, working clothes and a subway sandwich. I also got to shop stuff for next week when i go working. 
Im also annoying af when we are away, but hate when others are. Why?
Anyways i had to skip volleyball today cuz we were away ðŸ˜¿

Holy no journaling!
We also went to buy pumpkins, at home i did pretty much nothing first and then went to mow grass, it took like 45 min cuz i only did the large lawn and the alleyway and its houses yk. Ive then been scrolling reddit and yt in the couches. Im so tired, and we havent eaten dinner yet. Idk what to do rn, im bored. Ive thought about making an inventory management system for a retail store just to have something to do lol.
Fuck it im watching a movie lmao.

Update i am finally watching superintelligence again for once, and eating crackers. And my dad said that we are gonna eat Chinese for dinner!!

Nothing more for today, im kinda not looking forward to tomorrow when i go working since im not really interested in the work yk. Oh well ill manage, gn.
