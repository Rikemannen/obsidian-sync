I knew what i dreamt about but my lazy ass didnt write it down.

Quick journal before i fall asleep:
When we were away with school i took the medium difficulty map, took me 55 min. I ate one hamburger and some snacks that i brought. I then walked an easy round with my two friends ;)
I was thinking of telling them, but i ended up not doing it, it wasnt a good time, besides it doesnt really matter rn. I did however say one thing. I had gotten something weird in my eye were i had like a line or something that was blurry, and i told them that i was going to take, among others, a vision test to make sure i was fit to drive slow cars. And then she asked if i was gonna become a guy who blasts loud music etc in their car to impress people (its a general term but you get it), and i responded with "there arent any cute guys in school anyways, so it doesnt matter", she (i wasnt talking to both, Veronica had gone before us since we got the same map she got 30 minutes before, oh and me and Niva got the same maps we got last year lol) didnt say anything. If she had said something, thats when i wouldve come out, i think thats also the best way.

I also got a response from the people who called me [[September 14 2025]], they had called multiple people, some got mad cuz they were woken up, and others werent going to sleep for a while (mee!).

I played ragdoll universe aswell, and the very good guy was playing like constantly, so i didnt win any games. BUT THATS NOT THE POINT!!! I just like having fun, which is really (not) easy when the same guy from yesterday joins and calls me a kid and asks the other guy if im targeting him aswell. I fucking hate him so much :D

We ate at the china buffet aswell today. And my gay ass was looking for cute boys, none :(
We also shopped, and for some reason, every time we shop at that store, me and my brother go haywire. We also saw that they had ai videos on their candy stall or whatever. It was bad.

Oh and on the bus home the guys in my class started getting mad at eachother. It was like bad. One guy also started removing peoples seatbelts during the ride and they stopped the goddamn bus. We also got yelled at in the morning for ruining the table tennis stuff (well the ones who did it)

Anyways fuck annoying people and those who destroy stuff, i will try to gain courage to come out this week, and tomorrow is my one month anniversary of journalling ðŸ¥³
Im tired and going to sleep.

Also quick note, ive had a mild headache ever since lunch today, i gotta drink more...
