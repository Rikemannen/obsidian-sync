Idk what i dreamt about, i just forgot to journal ig, i have a vague memory of being with someone somewhere and spawning items or something and where you could have an owner and admins and guests, kinda like mc i guess. And the items were like radios and stuff. Idk anymore.

I did my morning stuff and measured like â…” of it all and then the others came and picked me up, and we went to the gold court. Over there we looked at an atv or smth that was electric. It was really cool, we also got to drive it and it accelerated so quickly. They didnt have engine braking on it which made certain people wait with buying until their software could handle it. It did cost like 240k, idk if thats much or nah but they said it was pretty good.

Anyways after that i kept measuring, the last one was hell. It was hard like brick. I did figure out that the thermometer stopped working/went haywire when the two contacts couldnt touch at the end, i just twisted them together and it worked. I had also forget to change pants and get my gloves which made my hands hurt and pants shit-covered.
Thats all, well we worked on the house after and the mix that had been made was dry like a desert and so it didnt really stick. We added water and mixed but it wasnt enough, that happened thrice. We are also out of sand so the current mixture is just 6 sand 3 clay and water, should be 9 sand.

Im eating pasta carbonara, its not as good as the two earlier meals.

Uhh we kept on building the house, we had one batch of dry ass mud but otherwise we kept on going like usual. I also got to put some on the wall.

During volleyball we did some passing around, i got coached a bit, then some like jumping training with kicking. We then played a match.
While drinking between the first and second things i sprayed water in my throat and started coughing and laughing like crazy, i also spit water everywhere god dam. My water bottle (brand new) is also leaking btw.

Yeah thats my day, pretty boring tbh, well so far, but i am kinda going to my cousins bday party!! Yeah thats fun.

Something i thought of today:
While playing volleyball i noticed how the others talked to each other and jumped on each others backs, thats literally what i wanna do... but when i do it its weird. I fucking hate this. And to make matters worse, i dont feel like i can make friends there. Sure we share a common interest of well volleyball, but what else is interesting about me? Oh i know:
- Im not really mentally stable 
- Im lonely af and the friends i have are in school only,
 i also love so isolated where nothing fun is nearby. "But you are on a farm! There is so much to do." Yeah if you like farming, but what if i want to go get a chocolate bar, what if i want to hang out with some people?? What the hell do i do??? Oh thats easy, you just bike 20 min to the nearest "big" village. But who the hell do i meet there? Thats right! No-fucking-body since nobody has my interests nor the energy to listen to my fucking yapping. And if i told all this to somebody, Yeah well how tf would they react? Nobody knows this... Fucking nobody.
 Holy getting to drive a car (slowly) is a fucking gamechanger. But damn if i fail that driving test, thatll be it. I will not be happy. 314.15926535897% certain that ill just give up. 5k just for nothing... 5k for a plastic card telling people that i can drive... Oh right, a moped, not a car? This logic is out the window.

Well we are here now and i didnt bring my laptop to socialize or smth idk what i thought, and my mom asked me if i took it with me so she could work, and now i really regret it. God i hate this, however we are eating tacos so :D

Im not feeling well. We played some hide and seek, and then just scrolled on phones, ate some cake and scrolled more, it was chocolate cake. Lastly we watched the presents being opened. She got some jewellery and something else i didnt see, oh no it was a gift card, Yeah thats that it was!

Anyways she also told us she got 120k from stuff like stocks and stuff. And it just made me sad fsr, i guess im just thinking i wont get it as good. Im just not ok rn. I wanna go to school again. Working with people i dont really care about sucks, school might be annoying at times, but its better. I also really want someone to go trick or treating with on halloween, but will i get that? Im worried.

Oh well atleast i have already showered now, so i can go and cry in bed after just brushing my teeth :)

Oh and i forgot to add, my cousin got a bottle of wine since she turned 18, thats fun ig.
