I was driving trucks with others. I also saw a video about a dino costume in a museum and some general pranks.

Omg time is 6 i just wrote that, i thought we had school bit we dont. God thats nice.

Today i helped my mom (and well i guess the guy owning the field but whatever) stack bales, i listened to music and sang out loud while doing it, it was fun.

After that i called the people who want laser stuff and then i moved the laser outside (to the workshop) into a little room. And i managed to get lasergrbl work on my laptop via a vm :D
I now just want an enclosure for it so i dont destroy my lungs from it...

I also installed nyarch in a vm cuz why not, its very much a weeb's dream is. Is also tried yiffos but it is still too hard.
I am now "watching" tv and its some kind of odd channel, the ads are cursed af, some are **really** loud fsr

I also ran out of space on my root partition on the laptop somehow.

Not much today HOWEVER, i am gonna try to Lucid dream! Wish me luck and goodnight.
