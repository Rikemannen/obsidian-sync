I remember seeing a board with words, first like two letters and then a full word, i remember valet parking being up there...
I also feel asleep without putting my phone on the charger, so its almost dead now.
We had crafts just now, i am now sitting in the couch next to Melvin and waiting for physics to start. 
During Crafts the guys were being anoying as usual, i wont bother typing th details but they basicallyy threw trash and stuff, we also had a substitute today.
