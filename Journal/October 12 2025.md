I dreamt about cooking food with 2 others. There was a **lot** of fish stuff. We had fish nuggets, salmon etc all precooked on multiple plates. I served like 3 people before waking up.

Oh and i got pancakes for breakfast!

We are now on the way to shop. Ive looked out the window a solid 10 minutes and it is starting to get boring. Idk what to write here but ill say some things that ive thought about.
I like how firstly i started just vaguely writing my dreams down here, and now we suddenly have a full on journal.

In my days of journaling i made some promises about future entries that never happened:
[[October 01 2025]] no, that is not true, [[Fuck it, journal²]] is more, just look at [[Fuck it, journal²#8 oct]]...

Ill add more later maybe, anyways we are on our way home, i have now gotten pants and a shirt to have outside my training clothes, shoes, working clothes and a subway sandwich. I also got to shop stuff for next week when i go working. 
Im also annoying af when we are away, but hate when others are. Why?
Anyways i had to skip volleyball today cuz we were away 😿
